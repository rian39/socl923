Our collective research topic this term has been 'fake news.' In your group projects you have investigated various ways of making sense of this recent controversy. Drawing on your experience of working on this topic, the various exploratory activities undertaken in your groups, and the in- class interviews with guest, as well as media and cultural studies readings, critically reflect on the following statement:
    'In its research practice, media and cultural studies is a way of making sense of a world that works primarily through, or in reliance, on media.' 1
In writing your essay, you are not expected to carry out new research, but you should draw on readings, concepts and analytical approaches discussed during the course.

Xi, this is a well-written essay and raises some really interesting issues. It offers a fairly sophisticated analysis of fake news, and of contemporary media cultures more generally. I was quite impressed by that. You make use of some key insights from the course, and extend them  through some of your own work. 

Although many of your observations about the topic of fake news were incisive and helpful in understanding the fake news, the focus of the essay was not strongly aligned with an analysis of what media and cultural studies can do in its research practice. Your essay definitely shows that you have been doing some research, but doesn't reflect on the strengths, diversity and limits of that mode of doing research. 

The use of academic sources was fine. I would really like to have seen material drawn more directly from your experience and thoughts about doing the group research project. For instance, how does your understanding of Couldry's notion of 'inside culture' actually impact what you think MCS can do? 

Writing, expression and referencing were all working well in this essay. Keep that up.

Kausiki, it was a real pleasure to read your essay. It shows awareness of the plurality as well as central problems of MCS. Well done on rapidly orienting yourself to the  key features of MCS, and developing a nuanced understanding of important connections between media, cultural, power, identity and experience. 

The body of the essay discusses a range of topics and approaches that figure prominently in discussions of method in MCS. I liked the way you moved through different perspectives, developing a critical analysis of limitations and potentials of different ways of researching culture. The account of visualities was particularly good.  

Your essay draws on a well-rounded collection of academic sources. These were skillfully synthesised. I would like to have seen more material drawn from your experience of carrying out the group research project. This after all was an occasion to think about what it actually means to be work with the premise of being 'inside culture' as a methodological axiom. 

The standard of written expression was very high.

Li-Sha, this was a well-organized and thoughtful response to the question. You show a developing sense of ethnography and its relevance to MCS. The essay was not so strong its engagement with other forms of research practice in MCS. You did not discuss textual analysis, visualities, discourse analysis and more recent 'live methods' in any great depth.   

You showed understanding of media culture as a contested terrain for social groups and ideologies. It would have been great if you discussed how that understanding affects or steers research practice in MCS. How would ethnography be relevant given that view of media culture, for instance? I was also wondering whether you thought the idea of studying culture from the inside, or of being inside culture as a researcher differs from the idea of studying culture as a phenomena to be known objectively. I liked your concluding reflections on the relation between world and media.   

One important aspect of the essay was missing: the critical reflection on your group research project. 

Your essay drawn on a wide range of references, including some from well beyond this course. I was please to  see you engaging substantially with the idea of digital ethnography.
