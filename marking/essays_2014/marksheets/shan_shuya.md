Shan Shuya,
this is definitely a much better easier than the version you first submitted. This time, you are actually answering the question, and the essay shows that you have thought a bit about how to answer that question. The selfie-instagram research project was an interesting one, and although you don't describe much about the design of that project, I can see that you encountered some interesting materials in the process of doing that project. I'd say that your essay now shows a reasonably well-informed understanding of the project of cultural studies, but I'm not sure that it deals very effectively with the questions of power, complexity and self-reflexivity in cultural studies. It would have been good to with these questions using examples and cases from the research project exercises done during the course.

I agree with the first marker. The essay now addresses the question and the course content. It is quite clearly written and covers some of the important conceptual areas of the course. I think it would have been interesting to think more critically about who is engaging with selfies online – there is a tendency here to speak about ‘people’ without unpicking this concept: which people? Where? Etc.
