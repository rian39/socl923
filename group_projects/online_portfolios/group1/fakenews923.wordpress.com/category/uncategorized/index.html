<h2>Rationale：</h2>
<p>This research is an exploration of fake news, specifically in relation to the  contemporary specificity of media today and celebrity culture. Textual analysis and visual analysis are the main methods used in our research. These two kinds of methods can be combined perfectly in most of our research activities. We can do compositional analysis for the visual materials then find related articles to complete the work. Through different methods the different sides of research questions can be seen and be discovered orderly.</p>
<p>We search related fake news examples and extract useful information. And we find out novel approach which is to combine methods and use some of them in others. That will help us understand them deeply. Everyone try different methods and we discuss together to summarize different opinions. That will be abroad used in the final complete research.</p>

<p>Fake News are various misleading information sources, each with different aim, function, creator and scenario. There are many different categories of Fake News and for our research we have chosen to mainly focus on one particular type: fake news featuring famous people, public figures aiming to challenge some political and social environments and to encourage participation and shock experience. We decided to examine this category of &#8216;fake&#8217; because it has many important theoretical and structural features. We were primarily interested to find out the obscured and manipulative effects of Fake News and the reasons for their appearance. That motivated our main research questions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>Research Questions</em></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Can fake news be understood in the specificity of media today?</li>
<li>Can contemporary fake news be understood in regards to celebrity culture?</li>
<li>Why do people believe in lies so easily: the courage to hear the truth?</li>
</ol>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Theoretical Approaches</span></em></p>
<p>Our aim is to find out the role that Fake News play in contemporary media and the propagandistic character  of their content. We are interested in the objects and figures featured in the variety of fake online sources. Also make an attempt to explore the connection between the visual structure of Fake News and the corresponding audience engagement and participation.The most useful theoretical frameworks to interpret and analyse the empirical materials collected and the selected set of questions, must allow us understand in depth the psychological aspect of Fake News and their visual and textual content structure.  We have chosen the following theories and concepts to analyse the research questions :</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Can fake news be understood in the specificity of media today? </strong>In order to research this question we will refer to the theoretical approaches that have already been discussed. In addition to them, we will make a reference to the concept of convergence culture. Henry Jenkins&#8217; discussions of the contemporary forms of media and interactive multi-platform content will be central for this part of our research. The modern media has achieved a great diversion of interactive narratives. We can use Jenkins&#8217; work to explain the audience participation with the Fake News environment. Analysis of convergence is essential for familiarizing ourselves with the various contemporary delivery channels and how we engage with them.</li>
<li><strong>Why do people believe in lies so easily: the courage to hear the truth? </strong>We found <strong>Nietzsche&#8217;s</strong> idea that <strong>people need their illusions</strong> and they live in a lie, very relevant and useful to explore media participants&#8217; ability to intentionally deceive themselves and consciously read doubtful sources . Another interesting way to approach this question would be exploration of the <strong>shock experience</strong> and how it reconfigures the participation practices and satisfies our unconscious inner necessity for lies and sensations. Walter Benjamin&#8217;s essay <em>The work of art </em>inspires looking into shock as both destructive of coherent experience and as an explosive potential for new experiences of a transformed world. Another interesting dimension  of that question can be investigated through the <em><strong>schadenfreude</strong> <strong>theory </strong></em>(related to the affect theory). It would help us understand why we are likely to take pleasure in the pain of those we envy. This theoretical approach is extremely useful for answering our third questions which is:</li>
<li><strong>Can contemporary fake news be understood in regards to celebrity culture?</strong>  The  study of <em><strong>schadenfreude </strong></em>and its implications is one way of approaching the Fake News content and topics. However, it is also important to see beyond our audience practices and motivations to open and read the Fake source. In our project we also want to analyse the consequences and effects that Fake News have. How do they change the moral values and thinking of the audience? Is the manipulative content aiming to achieve these changes: not only in terms of practices, but also in terms of psychological perceptions and views? We want to understand how Fake News work as a process and sequence of related events. Very useful here is the <strong>affect theory </strong>which provides understanding of how representations ‘work’ through inscribing, mediating and inviting emotions and emotional investments. The works of Margaret Wetherell, featuring the theory of <strong>affect and emotion, </strong>and of Anne Graefer&#8217;s focusing on the affective production of whiteness, will be a starting point for the detailed investigation that we will conduct.</li>

			<p><strong>Week 7   </strong><strong>Live methods Analysis on Design of Apple Website From 1996 to 2016</strong></p>
<p><strong>Link </strong></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/www.apple.com/">https://web.archive.org/web/*/www.apple.com/</a></p>
<p><strong>Background Information</strong></p>
<p>This week our group runs an Internet Archive Wayback Machine search on Apple website (<a href="http://www.apple.com">www.apple.com</a>) from 1996 to 2016 involving live methods. We divide the 20 years into 2 periods and use semiotic and textural analysis to make it easier and more clear for understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Live Methods Analysis</strong></p>
<p><u>Routine design: 1996 – 1998</u><br />
<img class="editor-featured-image__preview-image aligncenter" src="https://fakenews923.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/img_4152.jpg?w=450" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Figure 1: 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">    In 1996, Apple complied with the trend to design the website like an E-mail which shows the styled site with the banner, search bar, accessibility information, navigation, and sidebar. However, 2 years later, Apple renewed the website from a site to provide information of the company into a platform to introduce products. The design of 1998 laid the foundation for that in the following 15 years – highlighted 4 characteristics including a big sector in the middle of website which exhibited key products, few small sectors at the bottom which contained hot news, two or three sectors of secondary products, and a navigation bar at the top of the screen.</p>
<p><img class="editor-featured-image__preview-image aligncenter" src="https://fakenews923.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/img_4153.jpg?w=450" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Figure 2: 1998</p>
<p><u>Style design: 1998 – 2016</u></p>
<p>The website stayed as a product of Apple as well as a service to promote products, changing with the times and new information. We divide the whole page into four parts –from the top to the bottom, the design follows Pyramid Principles to put key words/introduction on the top and bottom and search engine in the middle. In figure 2, it shows ‘volume’. In the design, part 1 highlighted the product to attract readers. The design in 1998 lay the foundation of that in the following 19 years. Since then it is important to discuss how to improve 4 parts to adapt to suit consumers’ tastes.</p>
<p><img class="editor-featured-image__preview-image aligncenter" src="https://fakenews923.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/img_4154.jpg?w=450" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Figure 3: 2001</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">    Apple has always had a special relationship with the element of water (Aqua). In 2001, navigation bar and hot news sectors shared features of Aqua − such designs are often quite complex, include rich imagery and vivid animation effects.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><img class="editor-featured-image__preview-image aligncenter" src="https://fakenews923.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/img_4158.jpg?w=450" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Figure 4: 2008</p>
<p>    The space of the big sector kept expanding since 1998. In 2016, in order to promote new Iphone 6, the sector is double that of 1998. On the contrary, sectors of hot news became smaller and smaller and finally blended into the background in 2008. This change related to Apple’s brand awareness. In the 2000s, the official website transformed into a sales platform because Apple was so famous that it did not need to introduce company cultures specifically. And sectors of secondary became independent by adding outline border shadow.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="editor-featured-image__preview-image" src="https://fakenews923.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/b73i0v5mvwd4cpoy1kp.png?w=450" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Figure 5: 2016</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Apple focuses on details. In 20 years, like Imac and Iphone, its website revised and reorganized details, combining art, function, and self-created culture. We conclude main changes as following after viewing designs in 20 years: a) the simple design highlights core product and avoids secondary data accordingly; b) the clear navigation bar make users feel free to browse products; c) the same font in different sizes differentiate ‘volume’ of information; and d) the appropriate color matching, light and shadow make users feel comfortable. The process of changing is from ‘more’ to ‘less’.</p>
<p>In today’s discussion, our group describe initial observation of Apple by analyzing snapshots of their website, work on digital ethnography, and summarize the design path to success.</p>

			<h1>Imagining field sites</h1>
<h3>● List three specific places that you could study (given a few weeks!) as ethnographic field sites for your group research project</h3>
<ol>
<li>Online Douban group:</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.douban.com/group/144218/" rel="nofollow">https://www.douban.com/group/144218/</a></p>
<p>This is an online group called &#8220;Onion Time&#8221; on Douban website which will post every side of fake news reported in social media everyday. All of these fake news are made up by the group members. The original events are from daily life, happening among us. Being processed and fabricated they will become fake news, spreading widely for amusement.</p>
<p>2.  CCTV (China Central Television)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cctv.com/index.shtml      " rel="nofollow">http://www.cctv.com/index.shtml      </a> (or on TV directly)</p>
<p>CCTV is the biggest television station and the predominant state television broadcaster in China. Most of its programmes are a mixture of news, documentary, social education, comedy and entertainment.</p>
<p>3.  Kitchen (on meal time)</p>
<p>When we are cooking or eating meals with roomies in the same flat we share our ideas about news we are watching. There will always be a furious discussion on the interesting part of it, including fake news, which attracts us mostly.</p>
<h3>● List some of the people you would want to meet, talk to and spend time with in these places.</h3>
<ol>
<li>The group members. But unfortunately this group was seemed to be abandoned and there was no update since a long time ago. We can still see the previous work they did, maybe talk to the members about the reason why they did not insist to work on it.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s a kind of indirect communication and  direct reception of information on TV.</li>
<li>Roomie, friends and anyone we can meet in our kitchen.</li>
</ol>
<h3>● List some of the things, artefacts, practices or events you would want to observe or participate in as an ethnographer.</h3>
<h4>[ Hillary Clinton Sick with Pneumonia ]</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.livetradingnews.com/hillary-clinton-pneumonia-14947.html#.WMJekoXXJPb" rel="nofollow">http://www.livetradingnews.com/hillary-clinton-pneumonia-14947.html#.WMJekoXXJPb</a></p>
<p>Hillary Clinton was diagnosed with pneumonia Friday, her doctor said in a statement Sunday after the Democratic nominee left the 9/11 Remembrance Memorial ceremony at Ground Zero due to what her campaign said was “overheating”.</p>
<p>“Secretary Clinton has been experiencing a cough related to allergies. On Friday, during follow up evaluation of her prolonged cough, she was diagnosed with pneumonia,” her doctor, Lisa Bardack, said.</p>
<p>“She was put on antibiotics, and advised to rest and modify her schedule. While at this morning’s event, she became overheated and dehydrated. I have just examined her and she is now re-hydrated and recovering nicely.”</p>
<p>Video posted by a bystander to Twitter appeared to show Mrs. Clinton extremely unsteady and supported by aides, being helped from the curb into a vehicle.</p>
<h3>● How would you address the problems of access to sub-cultures, elites, niche social movements or marginal/vulnerable groups?</h3>
<ol>
<li>There will be some technical problems like group is close so we can not join in it; group was closed (had met) so the information and news are out of date; seldom update of articles and members are not active. -Try to find some opened and active groups.</li>
<li>The news on TV are all real news and our countries will announce  that the fake news is unreal. -They care about influence in media and we should make our choice.</li>
<li>We are always easy to chat on something not related to the fake news topic when we are have s discussion. -More focus and concentrate. Be serious.</li>
</ol>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Discourse Analysis in media and cultural studies was the main topic of discussion this week (week 5). Discourse is commonly defined as a ‘system of meaning’, it could be an overarching structure which underpins certain aspects of a thing e.g. a discourse on Truth, Value and Authenticity within news. Discourse analysis can be summarised as a general term describing a number of approaches that analyse written, vocal and significant semiotic events, in the context of Media and Cultural Studies it is used to make sense of textual and media environments. According to some scholars, discourse analysis should get an idea of the ‘big picture’, media cannot be understood as purely ‘visual media’ but beyond that, all media is mixed. Furthermore, discourse analysis should not understand media as a social construction of vision, but a visual construction of the social.</p>
<p>In todays group discussion we were asked to write a preliminary description of the institutional apparatuses (e.g. images and documents, Architectures of specific places, what experts, practitioners, professional and participants say or do), technologies and practices of audiencing that visually construct ‘fake news’. By looking at these aspects that underpin the visual construction of fake news we can start to analyse some of the overarching discourses key to fake news.</p>
<p>One thing that came up within our discussions was the question: Is fake news (F.N) a product/example of us living in a “post-truth society”? And if so, does this provide an interesting account of a discourse on truth present within F.N. articles? Perhaps ‘Fake News’ exemplifies that truth plays little role in our society and the knowledge that is circulated within it. This further raises the question: Who’s knowledge is considered true? Perhaps, in an age where individuals are no longer just consumers but also producers of media, truth is now also a ‘consumer good’ equally as vulnerable to manipulation at the hands of individualistic drives for success. As discussed in previous weeks, a common aim when producing media nowadays is the drive to make something go ‘viral’. There are many accounts of individuals within our growing online social media environment basing their success on ‘going viral’ e.g. YouTube sensations and ‘stars’ on the app ‘Vine’. Therefore in such a society where success and fame can be made for an individual by ‘going viral’, perhaps fake news is a product of this drive to find your fame.</p>
<p>A common feature amongst F.N. articles is the use of images to manipulate the truth. More often than not images are taken out of context and used to shed light on their own constructions of truth. For example:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="44" data-permalink="https://fakenews923.wordpress.com/2017/02/07/week-3/cher-dying/" data-orig-file="https://fakenews923.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/cher-dying.jpg?w=640" data-orig-size="451,515" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="cher-dying" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://fakenews923.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/cher-dying.jpg?w=640?w=263" data-large-file="https://fakenews923.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/cher-dying.jpg?w=640?w=451" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44" src="https://fakenews923.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/cher-dying.jpg?w=640" alt="cher-dying" srcset="https://fakenews923.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/cher-dying.jpg 451w, https://fakenews923.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/cher-dying.jpg?w=131 131w, https://fakenews923.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/cher-dying.jpg?w=263 263w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px"   /></p>
<p>In this snapshot of a fake news article we can very clearly see the manipulation by means of pictures. In order to ground many titles of F.N. articles, images from other sources are commonly used to illustrate their headlines. In this example we can see an unflattering, sickly image of the celebrity Cher used to evidence the claim that she is ‘DYING!’ however such claims are proven false when fact-checking this falsely constructed narrative. Moreover, highlighting words and phrases that accompany this image such as “Tragic Last Days”, “Depression”, “Suicidal”, and “My muscles feel like Jell-o” in eye catching yellow text are also used to catch the readers eye and force attention to their article. Overall, in order to distract the reader from questioning the truth of the article, producers of fake news appear to create sensationalised narratives which aim to provoke and excite the reader, in order to compel and flare up emotions, regardless of whether it is true or not.</p>
<p>To summarise, it seems that one of the most commonly used institutional apparatuses is images and documents in order to visually construct fake news and therefore illustrate a false narrative for the reader/viewer. This misconstrual of facts via the visuality of fake news may be a result of the growing demand of individuals aiming to go &#8216;viral&#8217; online by sensationalising hearsay and gossip that the reader will find entertaining in order to find popularity and success. If it is that we in fact live in a &#8220;post-truth&#8221; society, perhaps this society leaves a space for fake news to thrive &#8211; in an age where the construction of truth is treated like a consumer good, which can be sold to other individuals.</p>

<p>We did compositional analysis for images above. The first one is a magazine cover reporting Cher’s death, but we found it on the internet. They put it in the middle of the cover, taking an obvious place. The title also shows some other information but this headline attracts people enough. Cher in the image looks ill. That is a kind of cater to the content of news——to show a “dying Cher”. The second one is an image of Hillary Clinton. There posted a news “Hillary Clinton was diagnosed with pneumonia Friday, her doctor said in a statement Sunday after the Democratic nominee left the 9/11 Remembrance Memorial ceremony at Ground Zero due to what her campaign said was ’overheating’”. Hillary in the image looks not good, what makes people believe this news and spread on the internet. Both of them are image about death or illness of celebrities. Then we did a table on analysis as following:</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Compositional analysis:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Analysis of visuality：</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The different visualities mobilized in a shopping centre (Becker 2002; Degen, DeSivey and Rose 2008) are not the same as the visualities in an art gallery (Heath and vom Lehn 2004) or a train (Bissell 2009) or an expo (Jansson 2007a), because the practices in those sorts of place are not the same.</li>
<li>particular locations usually invite quite specific performances of seeing (which include specific modes of bodily and other sensorial comportments). Sitting in a cinema seat, the etiquette of where to put coats and bags, what to eat and drink there and how, when you can talk and when you shouldn’t, the specific kinds of gazes given to films (as opposed to invited by them, about which we know a lot)——all these things are peculiar to cinemas, and vary between different cinemas. Anna McCarthy’s book <em>Ambient Television </em>(2001) demonstrates the place-specificity of practice of looking in a different way, by unpacking the different modes of visuality structuring television programmes made for specific locations, such as airport lounges, hospital waiting rooms and checkout queues. Her study explores the co-constitution of nondomestic TV genres and the places in which they are shown very effectively (though, typically, she doesn’t say much about how the people in these places practice the TV).</li>
<li>Though, it is the practices undertaken in those places which reproduce them as those sorts of places (or not). If everyone started to wander in and out of all the cinemas in a multiplex just like they wander in and out of galleries in a museum, strolling down a side aisle, along the front and up the other side, inspecting the walls all the while, it would no longer be a cinema. Practices of looking, then, are also about the practicing of places.</li>

			<p><strong>Background Information</strong></p>
<p>A Facebook page named ‘R.I.P. Cher’ posted a confirmation of Cher’s death as following, which then was regarded as a hoax site that was infamous for fabricating stories around celebrities.</p>
<p>‘At about 11 a.m. ET on Sunday (September 11, 2016), our beloved actress Cher passed away. Cher was born on May 20, 1946, in El Centro. She will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page’. (From ‘R.I.P. Cher’)<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>As soon as it posted, thousands of fans expressed their sadness on the social media. And the page got nearly one million ‘likes’. Among thousands of comments, there were still hundreds of them expressed skepticism. The page’s description has been confirmed as a fake news soon, nevertheless, an interesting knock-on effect was that Twitter re-tweeted the fake news. ‘News about Cher’s death have been posted on the internet quite a few times in the past, which forced Cher’s official representatives to personally get involved and confirm that the 70-year-old isn’t dead’. (Frye., 2016, no pagination)</p>
<p><strong>Semiotic Analysis</strong></p>
<p>The signifier is a language object, while the signified is an abstract concept/ideology, and the relation between them is the sign which is usually an entity like a word or a representative. (Saussure, 1916, cited in Barthes, 1984) For this fake confirmation, signifiers are a series of symbols including the death and birth dates (September 11, 2016/May 20, 1946), sentimental words that aroused fans&#8217; sympathy (our beloved actress), and inflammatory statements that asked the audience to participate in memorial events (show sympathy by commenting on and liking this page). Date − an essential part in an obituary − is a convincing evidence to announce the death, which signified the truthfulness of the confirmation. Sentimental words not only declared the identity of this page was a fan but also reached the highly connected and influential fan community. However, it was a fake news; the page itself was a cyber marketing tool that aimed at winning fans and gaining influence. As for the second term, the signified (fans&#8217; comments) in the first term turned into the signifiers which signified the marketing purpose of the page. Since then, the marketing purpose attract more potential consumers/audience with the help of technologies (the social media).</p>
<p><strong>Textuality</strong></p>
<p>This page is a textuality on the social media Facebook. A website like ‘R.I.P. Cher’ is a type of textuality. Johnson (1990, cited in Stern, 1998, p.12) defined ‘text’ as ‘the manifestation of an open-ended, heterogeneous, disruptive force of signification and erasure that transgresses all closure.’ In the context, year of celebrity’s death transferred as a connotation. And readers transmitted information on the Internet by sharing, commenting on, and liking this page. The page had, therefore, a complex textuality, and for sure that different audience treated it differently. For example, fans of Cher may comment their sadness before distinguishing whether the page was official; other readers regarded the confirmation with skepticism.</p>
<p><strong>Textual Environment and Its Difference with Semiotic Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Textual environment formed by three patterns of movement including flows of texts, meanings, and potential readers. (Couldry, 2000) In this case, both structures of textual production and distribution are highly concentrated. Fans of Cher, the first group of people noticed this page as well as a second mass transmission for this death confirmation, who indirectly increased the influence of the page during the process of sharing. To attract the main audience, the page constructed a ‘coherent ideological formation’ (Couldry, 2000, p.82) through symbols mentioned in the second part.</p>
<p>The difference between semiotic analysis and the textual environment is roles of readers. Readers play important roles in the latter: netizens, compared with readers of the print media, are more like subjects stand in the text who interpret, recreate, distribute, and communicate information. Since then, readers co-produce with texts in the dynamic textual environment. However, readers tend to be receivers who encounter with texts in the semiotic analysis.</p>
