		<p>The subject of this week’s lecture was ethnography and how it works within sociological study.</p>
<p>“I want to understand the world from your point of view. I want to know what you know in the way you know it. I want to understand the meaning of your experience, to walk in your shoes, to feel things as you feel them, to explain things as you explain them. Will you become my teacher and help me understand?” – James Spradley, (1979)</p>
<p><strong>What is Ethnography?</strong></p>
<p>In essence, ethnography is the practise of studying people and cultures directly – it is a way of experiencing the world. From a sociological perspective, ethnography allows us to approach the study of culture in different ways, both reflectively and internally.</p>
<p>The internal approach means that we immerse ourselves within a culture, essentially blending into the background in order to try and understand it from the inside. We become part of the culture, and study it’s norms, traditions, rules, structures, etc… Ideally, this kind of study should have an air of the banal about it; the immersion into the culture should be natural to the point of uninteresting in order to try and make the observation as authentic and accurate as possible.</p>
<p>The reflective approach involves us writing from the perspective of an outsider – it’s our position as the “other” in a culture unfamiliar to us that offers us insight into how that culture works, perhaps as a direct contrast to what we are more familiar with. Our potential alienation – discomfort, even – offers us a point of reference that was can use to explore our understanding further.</p>
<p><strong>Why Ethnography?</strong></p>
<p>When adopting more traditional, formal, “hands-off” means of cultural study, there can be a certain barrier that is thrown up when subjects are fully aware that they are being studied. What people say and project and what they actually do can be two totally different things, so in order for a study to be properly authentic, that barrier needs to circumnavigated. Ethnography is a means of doing just that: By immersing ourselves into the culture we are studying, there is a sense of a “guard being dropped”, and the true nature of the study is revealed.</p>
<p>From an ethical standpoint, “being there” represents the best opportunity to present a proper, true and sensitive account. It also gives a voice to “the other” or cultures that might otherwise be overlooked and unheard by mainstream culture.</p>
<p><strong>Ethnographic Methodology</strong></p>
<p>Critical to the ethnographic method of study is the field site – the environment in which the study is to be carried out.</p>
<p>In the early days of anthropological study, the field site often referred to some far-off, exotic country where new cultures, often tribes, had been discovered and were being studies. In the modern day, the field site can be anything from a remote tribe, to an online messageboard, to the micro-cultural practices on display in high street shops… Essentially anything can be considered a field site. However, whilst anything could potentially be considered a field site for a study, there are often problems that are thrown up in terms of accessibility – can we actually access the site? Do the people there want to be studied? Is immersion even feasible?</p>
<p><strong>In Class Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Relative to our discussion on Ethnography, we talked about possible ways of employing a field site study into the subject of fake news, the overarching theme of this module. We considered various areas that could be useful, and arrived at the conclusion that some sort of study into the pro-Trump, Alt-Right community might provide an interesting environment in which to undertake research into the understanding of “fake news”. Specifically, we wondered if the idea of “fake new”s as we have come to understand it – concisely summed up in an advert for the New York Times, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY0Fdz350GE" target="_blank">“The Truth is Hard”</a> – tallies with the understanding of fake news from an American, right wing perspective. We suspected that perhaps it does, but that fake news as a tool of propaganda and media wrangling is proving so influential that the confusion around it is actually desirable, as it provides a powerful means to promote a conservative agenda.</p>
<p class="amp-wp-inline-a6ec8840dd8107f0c4f9cbd7d00cece0"><amp-youtube data-videoid="gY0Fdz350GE" layout="responsive" width="723" height="407"></amp-youtube></p>
<p>With reference to the in class exercise, we came up with the following proposed areas of research for an ethnographic study.</p>
<p><strong>Places:</strong></p>
<p><i>NRA Meetings in Texas</i> – Political views leaning one way or another are a crucial part in the nationwide identity of American states, and a group such as the NRA is fiercely pro-Republican and largely indicative of the American Right Wing.</p>
<p><em>Alt-Right Online Forums – </em>Online political forums represent an opportunity to study people’s viewpoints, often unfiltered through the enabling factor of online anonymity.</p>
<p><em>Anti Trump Protest Marches</em> – This is where you likely find the most vocal and vociferously opposed people to the Trump office, to look at alternate views and opinions.</p>
<p><amp-img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-406 amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/nra.jpg?w=723" alt="nra" srcset="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/nra.jpg 620w, https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/nra.jpg?w=150 150w, https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/nra.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(min-width: 620px) 620px, 100vw" width="620" height="413"></amp-img></p>
<p><strong>People:</strong></p>
<p><em>NRA Members – </em>Often made up of ordinary, working, Republican, Southern Americans. They could present an opportunity to get the views of the average Republican voter.</p>
<p><em>Moderators</em> – Online forum moderators would provide an interesting source of study, as their attachment to certain types of forum indicate an interest or approval of a certain set of beliefs, but their capacity within that as moderators means that they have to recognise inappropriate behaviour and comments in others who share similar beliefs.</p>
<p><em>Protestors – </em>It would be useful to study the background, education, lifestyle and economic circumstances of protestors in contrast to the backgrounds of the NRA Members to see if there are predispositions to certain beliefs based upon those factors.</p>
<p><amp-img class=" size-full wp-image-403 aligncenter amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/womens-march-2.jpg?w=723" alt="Women's March 2" srcset="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/womens-march-2.jpg?w=723 723w, https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/womens-march-2.jpg?w=150 150w, https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/womens-march-2.jpg?w=300 300w, https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/womens-march-2.jpg?w=768 768w, https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/womens-march-2.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/womens-march-2.jpg 1365w" sizes="(min-width: 723px) 723px, 100vw" width="723" height="301"></amp-img></p>
<p><strong>Artefacts, Practices, Events:</strong></p>
<p><em>NRA Lobby Groups – </em>Studying the political weight of the NRA in relation to their influence on proposed laws, and how they try and shape the political landscape based on the beliefs of the organisation.</p>
<p><em>Online Video Artefacts – </em>We would look at the types of videos watched and shared by the types of people who would populate Alt-Right forums.</p>
<p><em>Women’s Rights Marches – </em>We would posit that there is a shared sense of political beliefs between people that are firmly anti-Trump, and people who are active in social rights movements.</p>
<p><amp-img class=" size-full wp-image-404 aligncenter amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/womens-march.jpg?w=723" alt="Women's March" srcset="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/womens-march.jpg 457w, https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/womens-march.jpg?w=131 131w, https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/womens-march.jpg?w=262 262w" sizes="(min-width: 457px) 457px, 100vw" width="457" height="524"></amp-img></p>
<p><strong>Problems of Access:</strong></p>
<p>Whilst ethically dubious, it’s very easy to adopt any sort of persona you want on an online forum in order to immerse yourself and even participate in its culture and to view its practices. This would likely prove to be the easiest way of carrying out an ethnographic study out of the three proposed, but could result in inaccuracies in the conclusions drawn, because of the anonymity factor, the lack of interpersonal connections, and other aspects of interpreting meaning such as body language, etc…</p>
<p>Protest marches are done explicitly with the intention of making a particular point or being heard and are held worldwide, so getting protestors to air their opinions in an environment that promotes that shouldn’t prove too hard. Within that, however, there is the issue of physical access. A lot of protest marches are chaperoned by the police, and limited to very specific areas. There is also the threat of a protest ending in unrest and, in extreme cases, violence.</p>
<p>NRA meetings would likely prove the hardest to study, as the NRA is a closed, member only group. In order to get any sort of access to them in the first instance, you would have to convince them that you were either strictly neutral, or pro NRA politics. Not to mention the necessity to travel to America, where the NRA is based. And even then, a lot of conservative gun owners are acutely aware of the argument for gun control and may be reluctant to discuss it with an “outsider”, especially one coming from a country that already has strict gun control in place, such as Britain. Even with access to members, it would likely be difficult to overcome their assumptions about us and get a completely open and honest discourse.</p>
