				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we discussed the aim and objective of  the project in relations to the research questions that we came up with. The two research questions for this research project are :</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What is the discursive constitution of &#8216;fake news&#8217;?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What is the relation between the construction of credibility and the consumption of &#8216;fake news&#8217;?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The table below shows the research plan for this 3-month long research project on &#8216;fake news&#8217;.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="319" data-permalink="https://fakenewsgroup2.wordpress.com/2017/03/17/week-9-research-project-design-rationale/research-plan-2/" data-orig-file="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/research-plan2.jpg?w=723" data-orig-size="632,244" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;User&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1489788653&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Research Plan" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/research-plan2.jpg?w=723?w=300" data-large-file="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/research-plan2.jpg?w=723?w=632" class=" size-full wp-image-319 aligncenter" src="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/research-plan2.jpg?w=723" alt="Research Plan" srcset="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/research-plan2.jpg 632w, https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/research-plan2.jpg?w=150 150w, https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/research-plan2.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px"   /></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">As shown in the table above, the project has been divided into five different stages:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Literature Review</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">In the first three weeks of the project, each group member will conduct further background research on the topic of ‘fake news’. Past and current Media and Cultural Studies research on the topic of ‘fake news’ will also be explored. The scope of the research and research questions may be revised at this stage.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Collect Empirical Materials</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Additional texts will be collected at this stage to complement the sources already collected. The texts collected will be from various sources including:</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left:30px;">Tabloids e.g. The Sun and The Daily Mirror</li>
<li style="padding-left:30px;">Gossip Magazines and Websites e.g. National Enquirers and Heat Magazine</li>
<li style="padding-left:30px;">Mainstream media sites e.g. CNN and BBC News</li>
<li style="padding-left:30px;">Satire program e.g. Saturday Night Lives and The Daily Show with Trevor Noah</li>
<li style="padding-left:30px;">Newspaper e.g. The Daily Telegraph, The Guardian and The Daily Mail</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Analysis of the Empirical Materials</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">We will analyse the material individually using the most appropriate method, which may include semiotics, textual, compositional, visual or discourse analysis, in addition to ethnography and live methods, to answer the research questions posed in this research project.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Writing the Research Report</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The writing up of the report will happen at this stage. The result and findings of the analyses will be discussed in the report.  The implications and conclusions will also be drawn here.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Critical Reflection</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">We will reflect upon the analyses that we conducted during the research project and make any revisions and changes where applicable.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Research Rationale</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Research Question 1: What is the discursive constitution of &#8216;fake news&#8217;?</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning of the group project, the group discussed how there have always been varying degrees of fake-ness in the media, whether it is through tabloids, celebrity gossip sites, news satire sites and programs, different newspapers with different political &amp; social perspectives &#8211; all of which predated the 2016 US Presidential Election. Therefore, in this research study, we will be using a multitude of methodology that are frequently used in Media and Cultural Studies research to analyse the empirical materials that we will be collecting in the course of the project and explore the spectrum of fake-ness within the &#8216;fake news&#8217;. We hope to find different types of &#8216;fake news&#8217; with varying fake-ness, such as satire, rumour, gossip, unsubstantiated statements, and &#8216;fake news&#8217; that is related to the 2016 US Presidential Election, to name a few.</p>
<p><strong>Research Question 2: What is the relation between the construction of credibility and the consumption of &#8216;fake news&#8217;?</strong></p>
<p>At the same time, we would like to explore how the different components of &#8216;fake news&#8217; can contribute to the its credibility, which will subsequently influence how the audience consumed &#8216;fake news&#8217;. Examples from &#8216;fake news&#8217; websites would include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name of the Website</strong>: some &#8216;fake news&#8217; website have very similar names to a legitimate news outlet which can fool an untrained eye into thinking that the news is in fact part of the mainstream media landscape.</li>
</ul>
<p><img data-attachment-id="361" data-permalink="https://fakenewsgroup2.wordpress.com/2017/03/17/week-9-research-project-design-rationale/fake-news-watch/" data-orig-file="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/fake-news-watch.jpg?w=723" data-orig-size="1114,572" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;User&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1489790569&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Fake News Watch" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/fake-news-watch.jpg?w=723?w=300" data-large-file="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/fake-news-watch.jpg?w=723?w=723" class=" size-full wp-image-361 aligncenter" src="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/fake-news-watch.jpg?w=723" alt="Fake News Watch" srcset="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/fake-news-watch.jpg?w=723 723w, https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/fake-news-watch.jpg?w=150 150w, https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/fake-news-watch.jpg?w=300 300w, https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/fake-news-watch.jpg?w=768 768w, https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/fake-news-watch.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/fake-news-watch.jpg 1114w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px"   /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appearance of the Website:</strong> several &#8216;fake news&#8217; website look very similar to a mainstream news outlet website and contain no clue to indicate that the website may be &#8216;fake news&#8217; or satire. The Onion is one of the example of this as its website project legitimacy and for those who are unaware that this is a news satire site, there will be a difference in judgement used when consuming the content of this site</li>
</ul>

<p style="padding-left:30px;">By employing the various methods of analysis in this project, we will be able to identify the different elements of what constructs &#8216;fake news&#8217;  that lends itself to the legitimacy and credibility of &#8216;fake news&#8217;.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we are attempting the explore the spectrum of fake-ness in &#8216;fake news&#8217; in the contemporary media landscape as well as the how the construction of credibility in &#8216;fake news&#8217; sources can alter the public consumption of &#8216;fake news&#8217; in a post-truth age.</p>

<p>In <strong>Week 2</strong> blog, three textual materials are used as example and interpretations of &#8216;fake news&#8217;. They are, respectively, a news from a satire website The Onion named ‘Trump claims waterboarding doesn’t come close to the excruciating torment he experiences at every moment’; ‘How is Google doing in its fight against fake news?’; and the definition of &#8216;fake news&#8217; in Wikipedia page.</p>

<p>In <strong>Week 4</strong> blog, we use a award-wining photograph which is suspected as a composite of three different photos spliced together and a screenshot from a imitation show about Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton’s debate on ‘SNL’  to do the compositional analysis and visuality analysis.</p>

<p>In <strong>Week 5</strong> blog, we focus on fake news relating to Trump pre- and post- 2017 US Election to do the discourse analysis. We conclude the institutional apparatuses, power relations and audience engagement in &#8216;fake news&#8217;.</p>

<p>In <strong>Week 7</strong> blog, the transition of the McDonald’s webpage from 2000 to 2017 is used as examples of doing live methods for longer durations.</p>

<p>In sum, after looking through all the empirical materials and methods we’ve used from week2 to week7 , our group came up with two research questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What is the discursive constitution of &#8216;fake news&#8217;?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What is the relation between the construction of credibility and the consumption of &#8216;fake news&#8217;?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The first research question aim to explore the spectrum of fake-ness in &#8216;fake news&#8217; and complexity of the notion of fake-ness in the media landscape. The second research question will focus on the credibility of &#8216;fake news&#8217; through its convincing presentation and appearance in the media.</p>
<p>We have picked three different texts that are some of the most relevant for out research project and they are the following:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Brass Eye (1997) Clive Anderson shot dead.</strong> Available at: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGtdsXhXiEM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGtdsXhXiEM</a> [Accessed : 6 February, 2017]</p>
<p>This text is an video taken from a satire television program, Brass Eye. If the audience is aware that the programme is satire, they watch the show for the entertainment whereas the people who are unaware of the satire nature of the show, they will take the content of the program seriously.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Phipps, C. ‘Kellyanne Conway Blames Refugees for ‘Bowling Green Massacre’ That Never Happened.”</strong> <i>The Guardian</i>, Available at:  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/03/kellyanne-conway-refugees-bowling-green-massacre-never-happened">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/03/kellyanne-conway-refugees-bowling-green-massacre-never-happened</a>. [Accessed: February 3, 2017]</p>
<p>This text is a video of the news story showing Kellyanne Conway giving an interview about the &#8216;Bowling Green Massacre,&#8217; a terrorist attack that never happened. Without fact-checkers, the public will never find out about the inaccuracy of the news report.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Anthony, S. ‘Was the 2013 World Press Photo of the Year faked with Photoshop, or merely   manipulated?’</strong> <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/155617-how-the-2013-world-press-photo-of-the-year-was-faked-with-photoshop">https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/155617-how-the-2013-world-press-photo-of-the-year-was-faked-with-photoshop</a>. [Accessed: 10 February, 2017]</p>
<p>This text is an example of an award-winning photograph that was exposed as being doctored, this shows that with the advance in technology, sometimes the truth is not as simple and as obvious as what we see in the media.</p>
<p>Collectively, all of these texts showed a varying  degree of fake-ness within &#8216;fake news&#8217; and demonstrate that &#8216;fake news&#8217; is a global issue that pre-dates the 2016 US Presidential Election.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we focus on the ethnography and live methods. The group studied and analyzed the transition of the website of the fast food restaurant chain McDonalds over a period of 17 years ie. from 2000 to 2017, on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine. This method allowed us to empirically collect images of McDonalds website to form a visual essay to observe the changes in dynamics over a long period of time and see the larger picture of the organisation.</p>
<p><strong>History of McDonalds:</strong></p>
<p>Richard and Maurice McDonald opened “McDonalds Bar-B-Q” in California, USA in 1940 and its catapulted popularity led to its countrywide expansion to 102 outlets, by 1959. In 1966 McDonalds aired its first ever TV commercial and introduced the new face of the brand Ronald McDonald which was an instant hit and led to the creation of a new demographic of customers targeting children. In 1979 the Happy meal was invented targeting this new target group. Mcdonalds soon became synonymous with cheap and tasty meals, often criticized for its unhealthy high-sodium and high- sugar content. The documentary “Super-size me” released in 20004, highlighted the negative effects of a McDonalds-only diet. In response to pressure from childhood obesity groups, the brand started to promote healthier meals. In 2014, for the first time in a decade, sales went through a decline. Soon after the brand opened an office in Silicon valley to focus on digital innovation and a transparency campaign. Whether the brand can successfully reinvent itself as a promoter of healthy food and healthy eating remains to be observed. (FastCompany, 2014)</p>

<p>The homepage of the website in 2000, reflects a basic layout with almost no picture of food, devoid of any mention of nutrition facts. The look and feel was in tune with the static design characterized in the Web 1.0 phase, in which user interaction was minimal and information was heavy. The red brand color is retained in the website as well.</p>

<p>With the advent of the Web 2.0 phase, 2005 saw a major transformation in the website in terms of technicality as well as in message communication. Through the use of the Flash software, the website was made more user-friendly and interactive than the previous versions. The three paneled division in the centre of the homepage displays varied images covering diverse groups like children, mixed race groups, young and the old, implying the brand’s different target groups. Specific subsections focusing on Food, Nutrition and Fitness, Corporate Social Responsibility, make prominent appearance which the group felt was a reflection of the brand’s effort to transform the identity; from that of a cheap-unhealthy food brand towards one that promotes a healthy and nutritious food and to one that promotes inclusiveness by embracing diversity among people. The image of the brand as a ‘fun’ brand to be enjoyed with friends and family is also reflected. ‘Transparency’ in communication is also demonstrated along with a focus on the ‘humane’ nature of the brand.

<p>2010 reflects a major upheaval in terms of the look and feel of the website through animation created through programming/plug- ins as well as in message communication. Photographs of real food make an appearance along with attractive promotion of different food and beverage categories. People behind the food are introduced to dispel myths about the food offered. For eg. On being asked about the long-term goal for the McDonald&#8217;s menu, Chef Dan whose interview is published in the website replies that it is “to change people&#8217;s perceptions about our food not being real.” Values such as sustainability, recyclability-renewability, animal welfare etc. are highlighted. The continuous effort, as evident from the website, to focus on the ‘realness’ of the food and the emphasis on the authenticity of the food procured along with ‘values promotion’ can be read as a defense against the negative image of the brand perceived by the public. The background color shifts from Black to Grey.</p>
<p><strong>Year 2013:</strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="216" data-permalink="https://fakenewsgroup2.wordpress.com/2017/03/11/live-methods-for-longer-durations/year-2013/" data-orig-file="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/year-2013.jpg?w=723" data-orig-size="682,395" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Year 2013" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/year-2013.jpg?w=723?w=300" data-large-file="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/year-2013.jpg?w=723?w=682" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-216" src="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/year-2013.jpg?w=723" alt="Year 2013" srcset="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/year-2013.jpg 682w, https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/year-2013.jpg?w=150 150w, https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/year-2013.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px"   /></p>
<p>Retaining the overall look of the website, 2013 saw a slight modification in terms of more direct communication related to promoting healthy meals among children, ‘realness’ of the food and on the brand focus on CSR initiatives. The Left panel promotes Happy meals for children by focusing on healthy additions like apples and books to fit into the market as a brand that is concerned about children’s well being. The middle panel at the bottom links to the profile of the different food suppliers, retaining the brands effort to promote the authenticity of the food offered by introducing the ‘people behind the food’.  Efforts of the brand to position  itself as a ‘responsible’ brand by promoting charity and well being, is also re-emphasized by the addition of the right panel on CSR initiatives. The background colour shifts to Dark blue.</p>
<p><strong>Year 2017:</strong></p>

<p>Keeping pace with the user friendly interface adapted by most companies, by 2017, the website too implemented all features to make its website mobile/user friendly and easily accessible through promotion of mobile Application and by introducing videos, multi grid homepage layout, attractive visuals by retaining its focus on health-nutrition facts and by introducing value-for-money deals. Communication is also highlighted through focus on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. The background panel color is changed to black.</p>
<p>The group observed that the brand underwent major changes over the years, in terms of the maturity in content, visuals, design-layout and user-interface. The brand has made a consistent effort to change its identity from an unhealthy fast food chain to one that promotes healthy food and is concerned about its customers and the society. It is worth contemplating as to what extent the brand has succeeded in its attempt and whether this constant effort is reflected in its actual sales.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The subject of this week&#8217;s lecture was ethnography and how it works within sociological study.</p>
<p>“I want to understand the world from your point of view. I want to know what you know in the way you know it. I want to understand the meaning of your experience, to walk in your shoes, to feel things as you feel them, to explain things as you explain them. Will you become my teacher and help me understand?” &#8211; James Spradley, (1979)</p>
<p><strong>What is Ethnography?</strong></p>
<p>In essence, ethnography is the practise of studying people and cultures directly &#8211; it is a way of experiencing the world. From a sociological perspective, ethnography allows us to approach the study of culture in different ways, both reflectively and internally.</p>
<p>The internal approach means that we immerse ourselves within a culture, essentially blending into the background in order to try and understand it from the inside. We become part of the culture, and study it&#8217;s norms, traditions, rules, structures, etc&#8230; Ideally, this kind of study should have an air of the banal about it; the immersion into the culture should be natural to the point of uninteresting in order to try and make the observation as authentic and accurate as possible.</p>
<p>The reflective approach involves us writing from the perspective of an outsider &#8211; it&#8217;s our position as the &#8220;other&#8221; in a culture unfamiliar to us that offers us insight into how that culture works, perhaps as a direct contrast to what we are more familiar with. Our potential alienation &#8211; discomfort, even &#8211; offers us a point of reference that was can use to explore our understanding further.</p>
<p><strong>Why Ethnography?</strong></p>
<p>When adopting more traditional, formal, &#8220;hands-off&#8221; means of cultural study, there can be a certain barrier that is thrown up when subjects are fully aware that they are being studied. What people say and project and what they actually do can be two totally different things, so in order for a study to be properly authentic, that barrier needs to circumnavigated. Ethnography is a means of doing just that: By immersing ourselves into the culture we are studying, there is a sense of a &#8220;guard being dropped&#8221;, and the true nature of the study is revealed.</p>
<p>From an ethical standpoint, &#8220;being there&#8221; represents the best opportunity to present a proper, true and sensitive account. It also gives a voice to &#8220;the other&#8221; or cultures that might otherwise be overlooked and unheard by mainstream culture.</p>
<p><strong>Ethnographic Methodology</strong></p>
<p>Critical to the ethnographic method of study is the field site &#8211; the environment in which the study is to be carried out.</p>
<p>In the early days of anthropological study, the field site often referred to some far-off, exotic country where new cultures, often tribes, had been discovered and were being studies. In the modern day, the field site can be anything from a remote tribe, to an online messageboard, to the micro-cultural practices on display in high street shops&#8230; Essentially anything can be considered a field site. However, whilst anything could potentially be considered a field site for a study, there are often problems that are thrown up in terms of accessibility &#8211; can we actually access the site? Do the people there want to be studied? Is immersion even feasible?</p>
<p><strong>In Class Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Relative to our discussion on Ethnography, we talked about possible ways of employing a field site study into the subject of fake news, the overarching theme of this module. We considered various areas that could be useful, and arrived at the conclusion that some sort of study into the pro-Trump, Alt-Right community might provide an interesting environment in which to undertake research into the understanding of &#8220;fake news&#8221;. Specifically, we wondered if the idea of &#8220;fake new&#8221;s as we have come to understand it &#8211; concisely summed up in an advert for the New York Times, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY0Fdz350GE" target="_blank">&#8220;The Truth is Hard&#8221;</a> &#8211; tallies with the understanding of fake news from an American, right wing perspective. We suspected that perhaps it does, but that fake news as a tool of propaganda and media wrangling is proving so influential that the confusion around it is actually desirable, as it provides a powerful means to promote a conservative agenda.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='560' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/gY0Fdz350GE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></div></p>
<p>With reference to the in class exercise, we came up with the following proposed areas of research for an ethnographic study.</p>
<p><strong>Places:</strong></p>
<p><i>NRA Meetings in Texas</i> &#8211; Political views leaning one way or another are a crucial part in the nationwide identity of American states, and a group such as the NRA is fiercely pro-Republican and largely indicative of the American Right Wing.</p>
<p><em>Alt-Right Online Forums &#8211; </em>Online political forums represent an opportunity to study people&#8217;s viewpoints, often unfiltered through the enabling factor of online anonymity.</p>
<p><em>Anti Trump Protest Marches</em> &#8211; This is where you likely find the most vocal and vociferously opposed people to the Trump office, to look at alternate views and opinions.</p>

<p><strong>People:</strong></p>
<p><em>NRA Members &#8211; </em>Often made up of ordinary, working, Republican, Southern Americans. They could present an opportunity to get the views of the average Republican voter.</p>
<p><em>Moderators</em> &#8211; Online forum moderators would provide an interesting source of study, as their attachment to certain types of forum indicate an interest or approval of a certain set of beliefs, but their capacity within that as moderators means that they have to recognise inappropriate behaviour and comments in others who share similar beliefs.</p>
<p><em>Protestors &#8211; </em>It would be useful to study the background, education, lifestyle and economic circumstances of protestors in contrast to the backgrounds of the NRA Members to see if there are predispositions to certain beliefs based upon those factors.</p>

<p><strong>Artefacts, Practices, Events:</strong></p>
<p><em>NRA Lobby Groups &#8211; </em>Studying the political weight of the NRA in relation to their influence on proposed laws, and how they try and shape the political landscape based on the beliefs of the organisation.</p>
<p><em>Online Video Artefacts &#8211; </em>We would look at the types of videos watched and shared by the types of people who would populate Alt-Right forums.</p>
<p><em>Women&#8217;s Rights Marches &#8211; </em>We would posit that there is a shared sense of political beliefs between people that are firmly anti-Trump, and people who are active in social rights movements.</p>

<p><strong>Problems of Access:</strong></p>
<p>Whilst ethically dubious, it&#8217;s very easy to adopt any sort of persona you want on an online forum in order to immerse yourself and even participate in its culture and to view its practices. This would likely prove to be the easiest way of carrying out an ethnographic study out of the three proposed, but could result in inaccuracies in the conclusions drawn, because of the anonymity factor, the lack of interpersonal connections, and other aspects of interpreting meaning such as body language, etc&#8230;</p>
<p>Protest marches are done explicitly with the intention of making a particular point or being heard and are held worldwide, so getting protestors to air their opinions in an environment that promotes that shouldn&#8217;t prove too hard. Within that, however, there is the issue of physical access. A lot of protest marches are chaperoned by the police, and limited to very specific areas. There is also the threat of a protest ending in unrest and, in extreme cases, violence.</p>
<p>NRA meetings would likely prove the hardest to study, as the NRA is a closed, member only group. In order to get any sort of access to them in the first instance, you would have to convince them that you were either strictly neutral, or pro NRA politics. Not to mention the necessity to travel to America, where the NRA is based. And even then, a lot of conservative gun owners are acutely aware of the argument for gun control and may be reluctant to discuss it with an &#8220;outsider&#8221;, especially one coming from a country that already has strict gun control in place, such as Britain. Even with access to members, it would likely be difficult to overcome their assumptions about us and get a completely open and honest discourse.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Weekly Recap on Discourse Analysis</strong></p>
<p>This week, we were introduced to discourse analysis, a key method in Media and Cultural Studies. Discourse analysis is a system of things and meanings that can be used to make sense of the textual and media environments which is never isolated. Discourse analysis always looks at the broader picture and formation where all media are mixed and there is no such thing as ‘visual media’. To Foucault, discourse analysis involves groups of statements that structure how things are thoughts and how actions are based on those thoughts where there is less emphasis on meanings and more emphasis on how power is productive and can be derived from those thoughts and actions. However, discourse analysis can include the meanings of language, images, practice, and institutions as well as the focus on the historical formation of knowledge and how knowledge changes over time. Although, it might a challenging method to tackle as one may find it difficult to focus on a specific topic as it is an all-encompassing system.</p>
<p><strong>Preparing for Discourse Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Before we start the discourse analysis for this project on ‘fake news’, it is imperative that we must identify the authoritative account of ‘fake news’ and the variety of sources that are related to it. In the case of ‘fake news’, the institutional apparatuses, technologies, and practices of audiencing that visually construct ‘fake news’ must be determined. For this particular analysis, we are focusing on ‘fake news’ relating to Donald Trump pre- and post-2017 US Election.</p>
<p><strong>Institutional Apparatuses </strong>in the case of ‘fake news’ involving Trump will include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Creators of ‘Fake News’</u></strong> which include the creators of the recent ‘fake news’ phenomenon from Macedonia, Russia, Romania and the US as well as news satire websites (e.g. the Onion) and satirical television programs (e.g. The Daily Show with Trevor Noah and Saturday Night Live).</li>

<p><strong>The Power Relations and Audience Engagement in ‘Fake News’</strong></p>
<p>Of course, these only are some of the institutional actors in ‘fake news.’ There are, however, other non-institutional forces at play, one of which is the power relations between knowledge, truth, and power which add more questions to the process. One issue raised is the production of knowledge in a post-truth political landscape where Trump, the President of the United States of America – a leader of a country, whose sanity and statements are being questioned on a daily basis. Another key player in the prevalence of ‘fake news’ is the audience where their engagement to ‘fake news’ can be varied. For example, the audience will react differently to ‘fake news’ depending on their knowledge of US politics, their political views and their awareness of news website vs. news satire sites vs. fake news sites. Those who are adequately aware of US politics will exercise a sensible amount of judgement when faced with ‘fake news’ – the same can be said to those who are aware of news satire sites or ‘fake news’ sites, they will not take those ‘news’ seriously. The audience’s political leanings will affect their judgement in digesting ‘fake news’ as they may be biased and chose to believe a story that portrays the opposing party negatively. Moreover, the visual of ‘fake news’ and satire news sites are formatted like the sites of mainstream media which may cause confusion to the audience as they may not be able to adjust their perception and judgement in order to deal with the information provided by those sites. Furthermore, once the audience viewed and read these ‘fake news,’ there are several actions they could take. They can do nothing, talk about it with their friends and family or share it online through social media sites where the latter two would further fuel the widespread ‘fake news’ epidemic through this word of mouth and sharing process.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this blog entry starts to identify the institutional apparatuses of ‘fake news’ and highlight the role of audience engagement and participation in the ‘fake news’ phenomenon which is the starting point of using discourse analysis as a method to make sense of ‘fake news’ in today’s current textual and media environments.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week’s discussion is regard to the compositional analysis and visuality analysis of &#8216;fake news&#8217;. Two visual entities are selected as examples of &#8216;fake news&#8217;. The first one is a journalistic photograph which won the first prize of spot news in the contest of 2013 World Press Photo. The second is a screenshot from a imitation show of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton’s debate on ‘SNL’.</p>
<p>The award-wining photo <i>Gaza Burial</i> in question, an image by Swedish photographer Paul Hansen shows a group of men carrying the bodies of two children killed in an airstrike through Gaza City. According to the results of a forensic analysis published by ExtremeTech, it might be a composite of three different photos spliced together (see appendix) and then altered to illuminate the faces of the subjects.</p>
<p>This is a central placed image. The group of people block the street in Gaza city. The bodies of two-year-old Suhaib Hijazi and his elder brother Muhammad, almost four, are covered with plain white cloth and carried by their uncles to a mosque for their funeral. Men in the image are filled with deep sorrow: they are bowing their heads and crying bitterly for the lost of young lives, raising their  hands and shouting to protest against airstrike. There are stone buildings without window on the two sides of the narrow old street. The photo has a vertical feeling with two boys in front and in the very deep depth of field, electric wires connected to the telegraph pole are all in a mess.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The overall tone is saturated. The front men all are in dark and the colour of background is in low degree of saturation. Because the group of people are standing in a narrow street with high buildings on both sides, the natural light is from the top right corner to the left bottom of the photo. In this way, half of men are in light and the rest are in the shadow. The viewer’s position is in front of the group of people and a little higher than them in order to look further.</p>
<p>For people who are local to such war-ridden places, they might recognise this photo as a common image. They are so shocked, frightened, or upset for a long time that they cannot think clearly or feel any emotion about war, about the lost of family members. This makes me think of a picture of a five-year-old boy saved in ruins in Syria. He is totally dusty and with blood on head whereas his expression varies from poker-faced to blank. Perhaps he has been numb to war. On the contrary, if people live in peace, war is not something they can see in daily life, they might feel shocked and angry of it. This kind of emotional relations and shock experience may promote the circulation of such visual entities and let more people be aware of the topic about war and peace. In this way, this kind of photo can appear in the contest of spot news, in the poster and website of the anti-war organisations, and also in the social media platforms.</p>
<p>The second example is a screenshot from a imitation show of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton debate on ‘SNL’. The video shows two performers who look like Trump and Clinton having a discussion. In the picture Trump (Alec Baldwin) is on the left side, in a black suit and with humoristic expression. On the other side Clinton (Kate McKinnon) is wearing a red suit. She has a perfect makeup and looks really elegant and graceful. The artificial light in the news room gives both of them a bright appearance. The dark blue background provides a distinction effect of the front figures. Viewers of this picture is just a face-to-face position.</p>

<p>This video is live from Hofstra University. People can get access to it on Youtube, social news website (e.g. Digg), and entertainment websites (e.g. Entertainment Weekly). As above-mentioned websites support their viewers to share content to other social platforms, people can also see the video in Twitter and Facebook. From the different portrayals of Trump and Clinton in the picture, it is clear that the political stand of the video maker is to support Clinton. As for people who are Clinton loyalists, they may get great fun of this video and are willing to share the content in their own social media. But for Trump supporters, they may feel disappointed to this or even get angry. Overall, different emotional relations of this picture is according to people’s political stand and whether or not they are concerned about American Presidential Election.</p>
<p>In sum, the compositional analysis is more about close viewing. It focuses on rich description of the visual entity and does not say much about meaning or connotation. The analysis of visuality involves in ‘what happens when people look and what emerges from the act’ ( Morra &amp; Smith, 2006, p.273). A kind of performativity of practice is related to seeing and looking.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The group discussed two contrasting texts of &#8216;fake news&#8217;, one is YouTube video whilst the other is online news report.  We conducted semiotics and textual analyses on both texts which will be seen below.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><em>First text &#8211; &#8220;Clive Anderson Shot Dead&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='560' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/EGtdsXhXiEM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></div></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The first video discussed by the team was a fake news report by Channel 4, a British public-service television broadcaster, declaring the death of TV presenter and broadcaster Clive Anderson, allegedly shot dead by television host Noel Edmonds (Brass Eye, 1997). After a woman news reader in a grave voice, announces the killing of Anderson by Edmonds, a woman reporter with a fake moustache is shown telling viewers about the police siege, outside Edmond’s residence where his lookalike is shown firing a rocket launcher at  a wedding banquet and is then shown throwing Anderson’s head out of the window.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">In this text, the semiotics of &#8211; the set of the news room, the authoritative tone of the news reader, the placement of graphics and the camera angles used, were all replicated to represent an actual news broadcast.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">People interviewed for reactions on the news were not aware that the whole thing was staged. While the actual verbatim used by the news reader had a comical undertone, there were different ways in which the audience reacted to it: while some viewers took it literally and believed the news to be real, some viewed as a satire (Free Online Library, 2017).The textuality of this news broadcast apart from the real life ‘appearance’, especially with respect to the aspect of timing, creating a break from the usual routine, generated varied reactions of shock, contempt, interest and laughter among the viewers.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><em>Second text &#8211; Kellyanne Conway and the &#8220;Bowling Green Massacre&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div style="width: 640px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-61-2" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2017/02/06/170206bowlinggreen_desk.mp4?_=2" /><a href="https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2017/02/06/170206bowlinggreen_desk.mp4">https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2017/02/06/170206bowlinggreen_desk.mp4</a></video></div></div>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">In the wake of the recently proposed travel ban on seven Muslim majority countries, by the American president Mr.Donald Trump, Kellyanne Conway- counselor to the president, supported this ban by referring to a “Bowling Green massacre”, a massacre which never actually took place. The news was telecast in the Hardball, an American talk show hosted by Chris Matthews on MSNBC channel. Conway quoted, “I bet it’s brand new information to people that President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalised and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. Most people don’t know that because it didn’t get covered” (Guardian, 2017a).</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">In this text, the semiotics of &#8211; the interview broadcasted at the fixed time in a real set, Conway delivering the answer with absolute seriousness, the interviewer not cross questioning Conway, all contributed to the news to be considered as ‘real’.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Criticizing the false news, residents of Bowling Green expressed dismay at the attempt made by the Trump campaign to reinforce stereotypes about certain groups/ communities, especially those concerning refugees practicing Islamic faith. It is essential to look at the “text” used in order to delve deeper to decipher the deeper meanings of this false piece of news. Dr. Patricia Minter of Western Kentucky University, aptly analyses the incident and observes that the choice of words made by Conway is deliberate and loaded, both politically and culturally with terms that are designed to frighten people into fearing a certain group, in this case- Iraqi refugees, or in this case, the entire refugee community (Guardian, 2017b).</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Parallels could be drawn to a similar incident in India which took place last year, when the current government stirred up a media led hysteria over a alleged anti- India (doctored) speech made by the student leader of the prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) which led to mass protests by the public enraged over attack and arrests of the concerned students (BBC, 2017). The text- in this case, the video-audio manipulation was done in a manner to appeal to the public consciousness on nationalism and to create negative opinion about the said university and its students, which was a part of a broader political agenda targeting the university, faculty and its students.</p>
<p>Couldry (2000) defines text as one that involves “a complex of interrelated meanings which its readers tend to interpret as a discrete, unified whole” and defines textuality as “different ways in which something can function as a text for its readers” (p.70-71).Textual analysis covers analysis of any text which can include all verbal-written text, images, videos, paintings etc and can involve any kind of analysis within it- semiotics, compositional, visual, discourse analysis or ethnography or live methods. Semiotics can be considered as a part of textual analysis in which signs and symbols act as the ‘text’, it refers more to the visual text and meanings are thus derived from the used symbols, visuals or signs used.</p>
<p>From the videos that we studied as a part of the week’s group work, we conclude that the depending on the extent  to which an individual/audience engages with ‘news’ in ever day life he/she will react differently  to satire or news that appears ‘fake’ and to news which does not appear to be overtly ‘fake’. Both semiotics and text will therefore affect the consumer of fake news differently, depending upon his level of engagement with the media form.The group felt that in view of the instantaneous nature of online/mass media , it is easier to spread false news without any factual evidence in order to create the desired effect, by any vested interest group. Often such news is released when the environment is already tensed and volatile, fuelling further unrest and fear among the public.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we discussed the topic of ‘fake news’ further, specifically our own personal experience with ‘fake news’. We also tried to clarify our understanding of what ‘fake news’ is and whether ‘fake news’ emerged as a result of the 2016 US Election or whether this phenomenon has always been a part of society as we dealt with the varying spectrum of ‘fakeness’ in the news on a daily basis for decades. This week we also came up with three empirical materials related to fake news that demonstrate and explain what ‘fake news’ is to us, these are shown below:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>“Trump Claims Waterboarding Doesn’t Come Close To The Excruciating Torment He Experiences At Every Moment”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img data-attachment-id="223" data-permalink="https://fakenewsgroup2.wordpress.com/2017/02/03/our-thoughts-on-fake-news-the-possible-research-approaches/the-onion/" data-orig-file="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/the-onion.jpg?w=723" data-orig-size="899,633" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;User&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1489705606&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="The Onion" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/the-onion.jpg?w=723?w=300" data-large-file="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/the-onion.jpg?w=723?w=723" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-223" src="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/the-onion.jpg?w=723" alt="The Onion" srcset="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/the-onion.jpg?w=723 723w, https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/the-onion.jpg?w=150 150w, https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/the-onion.jpg?w=300 300w, https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/the-onion.jpg?w=768 768w, https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/the-onion.jpg 899w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px"   /></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">This very provocative headline came from the news satire website, TheOnion.com. To those who are aware that The Onion is a media company and a news satire organisation, this headline is not being taken seriously as we know it is written with humour, irony, and exaggeration. However, those who are unaware of this would take this headline at face value and consider this piece of information as true and accurate. As a matter of fact, on the 29<sup>th</sup> of January 2017, Sean Spicer, the White House Press Secretary retweeted a video called “5 Things to Know about Sean Spicer” that was tweeted by The Onion with the caption “@SeanSpicer&#8217;s role in the Trump administration will be to provide the American public with robust and clearly articulated misinformation,&#8221; an unfortunate misunderstanding that resulted in his being ridiculed by countless of people online.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>“How’s Google Doing In Its Fight Against Fake News?”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img data-attachment-id="224" data-permalink="https://fakenewsgroup2.wordpress.com/2017/02/03/our-thoughts-on-fake-news-the-possible-research-approaches/nbc-news/" data-orig-file="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/nbc-news.jpg?w=723" data-orig-size="1218,636" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;User&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="NBC News" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/nbc-news.jpg?w=723?w=300" data-large-file="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/nbc-news.jpg?w=723?w=723" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-224" src="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/nbc-news.jpg?w=723" alt="NBC News" srcset="https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/nbc-news.jpg?w=723 723w, https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/nbc-news.jpg?w=150 150w, https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/nbc-news.jpg?w=300 300w, https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/nbc-news.jpg?w=768 768w, https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/nbc-news.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://fakenewsgroup2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/nbc-news.jpg 1218w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px"   /></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">This second headline came from NBC News website where the news article summarised how Google is reviewing more than 500 websites and restrict ads from more than 300 sites for violating their policies for &#8220;misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher&#8217;s content, or the primary purpose of the web property.” Google’s policy update is a step in the right direction to combat the prevalence of ‘fake news’ leading up to and after the 2016 US Election – we can only hope that Facebook, as well as other affected sites, follow suit.</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;">This last source is a Wikipedia page that is dedicated to ‘fake news’ websites. The page provided a definition of ‘fake news’ where the main agenda is to “mislead, rather than entertain readers for financial, political, or other gain” – it even distinguished ‘fake news’ from news satire. The page contained a large amount of information on ‘fake news’ coverage, its definition, history, sources and impact amongst other things. Wikipedia may not be the most reliable website but it is a good starting point if you want to learn more about the ‘fake news’ phenomenon.</p>
<p>None of us had experience ‘fake news’ with regards to the 2016 US Election but we are all aware of the issue because it has been in the news. We all agreed that the concept of ‘fake news’ predates the 2016 US Election, we believe that there had always been a varying degree of ‘fakeness,’ i.e. inaccuracies and biases, in the news. Sometimes we have many questions as we struggle to know what is real; what is fake; who is reporting it; what gets reported; who controls the media; what about ownership of media. Because of the current media climate, we have come to expect that not all news reports are 100% accurate. We need to adjust our perception and use our judgment to decide whether the news is reliable, accurate and valid.</p>
<p>Easter, who is from China, experienced ‘fake news’ on Weibo (China’s hybrid version of Twitter and Facebook) where some articles are based on fabricated celebrity interviews with falsify sources and information which caused lots of confusion and misunderstanding among their users. Whilst Kausiki, who is from India, is aware of spoof and parody sites, she is also very aware of the biased and inaccurate reporting that exists within India’s media industry. She offer an example of a media company in India that is owned by an individual whose agenda is influenced by the political party that is in power. This resulted in interference and manipulation of news reporting which aimed influence and bend the public’s opinion. For me, I am certainly aware satire news, gossip sites, and tabloids, both in the UK and Thailand. I have also experienced how media companies in Thailand are influenced by certain political parties and the state which resulted in biased news reporting. Like many other countries in Asia as well as other parts of the world, censorship is something that is a fundamental part of news reporting in Thailand whilst freedom of the press and freedom of speech remained an unfamiliar concept.</p>
<p>To conduct a research study on ‘fake news,’ there are many different approaches that may be suitable. Because the materialist approach viewed culture as the result of what particular people have done at a particular time and place, under certain constraints and experience. It is possible to research ‘fake news’ using this approach to explore the production of ‘fake news’; their motivations behind producing these fake news – is it merely for monetary gains or is there a bigger agenda at play?  It is also possible to explore people’s experience with ‘fake news’ because even though we may view the same ‘fake news,’ we may react differently and have contrasting opinions about it.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are other approaches that may be suitable, one of those is affect theory. It would be very interesting to explore ‘fake news’ in relations to affect. We might be moved by the stories or it might invoke a negative affect of disgust towards the subject in the ‘fake news.’ It would be fascinating to investigate the role that ‘fake news’ play in the 2016 US Election. Because of the ‘sticky’ tendency of affect, the negative affect of a figure, such as Hilary Clinton, may build up negative emotions associated with her that could escalate to the feeling of disgust towards anyone with a liberal view or those who subscribe to the Democrat Party. Conversely, the research could also take on a Marxist view with a focus on the underlying economic motivation behind ‘fake news’ where the research on the commodification and ownership of media regarding the production of news stories and the agenda of those who produced it, would be a very interesting albeit challenging take on ‘fake news’.</p>

<p>Prior to the lecture on 20/01/17, we had all heard of the term “fake news” but none of us really had a good understanding of what that phrase actually meant. We understood it to means “news stories which are not real”, but all agreed that stories like that have been around for a long time, yet the term “fake news” has only recently been coined in the aftermath of the Donald Trump election. In this project, we aim to demonstrate the significance of &#8220;fake news&#8221; in the media and cultural studies landscape.</p>
<p>We discussed some themes that came up around the idea of &#8220;fake news&#8221;, and talked about the following three points:</p>
<p><strong>Context</strong> – the idea that &#8220;fake news&#8221; only seems to be called as such when read in a certain place or when being passed off as a genuine story, for example, someone who reads the National Enquirer or a celebrity gossip magazine probably does so already accepting that these stories are “fake” or deliberately taken out of context. We take them with a pinch of salt.</p>
<p><strong>Filter</strong> – the idea that on social media, we are unable to filter where news comes from and so we might read a “fake news” story with the same sense of legitimacy that we would read an article from a reputable news source like the BBC. This is possibly because we often see news stories through second or third hand accounts, through sharing. Your first encounter with an article might be through it being shard by a friend of a friend, and so you read the article without a firm grasp of the source, and whether that source is legitimate or not.</p>
<p><strong>Agenda</strong> – the idea that ALL news is &#8220;fake news&#8221; to an extent, in that it&#8217;s extremely difficult to read about stories in a truly unbiased way, as every media outlet has it&#8217;s own agenda to push, be it the conservative, right wing leanings of the Daily Mail, or the liberal, left wing views of the Guardian: Every media source makes you view the story through the lens that it holds up for you.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/fakenewsgroup2.wordpress.com/33/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/fakenewsgroup2.wordpress.com/33/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fakenewsgroup2.wordpress.com&#038;blog=122891056&#038;post=33&#038;subd=fakenewsgroup2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>
