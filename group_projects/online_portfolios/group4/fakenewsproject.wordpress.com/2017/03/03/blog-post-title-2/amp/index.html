		<p>Working With Texts: from semiotic to textual environments</p>
<p>As my colleague Olie indicated in last weeks post, Couldry states that anyone can contribute to culture by going “inside culture”(Couldry 2000: 4). However, for researchers of media and cultural studies, the question is what methods we can apply in order to analyse media and culture, as part of a ‘dense network of interconnections between texts'(Couldry 2000: 69). In this sense, we shall employ textual analysis and explore both semiotics and the textual environment, which will not only consider the text independently but also the textual environment, consisting of various patterns of flows; flows of meanings, texts and potential readers (Couldry 2000: 87). Couldry recognises textual analysis as a method which enables the researcher to unpack complex “interrelated meanings which its readers tend to interpret as a discrete, unified whole”(Couldry 2000: 70-71). In short, ‘texts’ can be objects or items, such as basketball shirts, cereal packages, films or magazines, sharing different forms of textuality or tactics (Couldry: 2000). Thus, textual analysis represents a sociologically informed approach to texts, which considers texts as social objects commanding different levels of engagement. As such by ‘de-centering’ a text we may understand it as a mere component of an entire textual environment navigated by audiences in a variety of ways (Couldry 2000: 69). In order to exemplify this method we shall deconstruct the image below through an application of textual analysis coupled with a semiotic analysis, due to the images systematic features which render semiology a useful tool in this instance (Couldry: 2000).</p>
<p><amp-img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-91 amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/16473419_10154019318571486_4975693996099856437_n.jpg?w=1000" alt="16473419_10154019318571486_4975693996099856437_n" srcset="https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/16473419_10154019318571486_4975693996099856437_n.jpg 625w, https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/16473419_10154019318571486_4975693996099856437_n.jpg?w=98 98w, https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/16473419_10154019318571486_4975693996099856437_n.jpg?w=195 195w" sizes="(min-width: 625px) 625px, 100vw" width="625" height="960"></amp-img></p>
<p>The image above, which is a segment from a propaganda leaflet which was distributed across Britain during Brexit and in most cases put through peoples letter boxes, proposed that it was offering impartial and factual advice. As one of the researchers received the leaflet itself we were lucky enough to be able to have access to these details of its original textual environment and intended audience and purpose. The information presented suggests that large portions of the Albanian, Macedonian, Montenegro and Syrian populations, will migrate to Britain when these countries join the European Union and if Britain voted to remain.</p>
<p>As semiology is most suited to texts which have undergone cultural production including systematic features, the method is highly applicable here. However, it should be noted that semiology is not a ‘general science’ and should not be applied to cultural signs in general as Couldry critiques (2000: 75). In its most basic form, Semiology refers to ‘the study of signs’ which are “are units of meaning, and semiologists argue that anything that has meaning” may be analysed using this method, as these meanings arise out of relations between key signs in texts (Rose 2007: 75/79). Thus, the text above consists of a system of signs which connote and reproduce specific meanings. The immediate sign one notices in the text is the map alongside recognisable icons of human figures, with the male icons being more predominant in number and positioning. Connotations of which imply that the immigrants will be more likely to be male than female, whilst the choice of the colour red connotes a semiotic reading of blood and danger. Further still, this semiotic construction of dangerous male immigrants is juxtaposed with the navy blue image of Britain, signifying a sense of infiltration and difference. Similarly the main colours in this pro-nationalist image deliberately mirror the colours in the national flag, connoting a sense of collectivism, but only among the nation itself. These simple construction techniques ensure that before the audience has even engaged with the writing, a hostile and nationalist rhetoric has been produced, demonstrating the salience of semiotic analysis for uncovering that which may ordinarily be taken for granted.</p>
<p>The writing “If we vote to stay in the EU”, “the EU will continue to grow” and population figures (which when checked further are for the most part rounded up), are also printed in bright red, reinforcing the intention to scare people and prompt people to ‘vote leave’, regardless of the non-existent evidence for these predictions, mirroring key components of fake news. Thus, the text is deeply problematic and reinforces an Orientalist perspective, outlined by Said as the lens through which the West views the East as barbaric, backwards and characterised by Islamic fundamentalism and violence (1991). A perspective that is reaffirmed in the text at the bottom of the image which warns readers that, “The next countries the EU wants to let in include Turkey, which has a population of over 76 million, and borders with Syria and Iraq”, which selectively highlights these Muslim majority countries in an attempt to conjure connotations of fear, difference and ‘other’ these groups. Although it should be noted that the types of Islam these countries ascribe to is very different and there is equal amounts of religious diversity within each nation, despite the implied homogeneity the text implies. Thus the texts semiotic reading reproduces troubling hegemonic discourses of Orientalism through mere choices of colour, imagery and text, a perspective which arguably lead to the successful victory of the Leave campaign, as Britain voted to leave the European Union in 2016.</p>
<p>For Couldry, textual analysis takes into account “the different ways in which something can function as a text for its reader” which is essential here, as the discussion above is highly unlikely to mirror the perspective of the wider audience at the time; demonstrated by the occurrence of Brexit itself (Couldry 2000: 71). Although propaganda leaflets possess a set of conventions and a predominant form, there are myriads of different forms in this textuality as “[i]t is not a stand-alone reference point”(Clancy: 2014). Not only does the producers decisions to arrange the information in different spaces or styles shape the readers understanding, the readers own pre-conceived ideas will also inform their reading of the text. In this sense, if we want to be clear about textuality, we need to ask firstly how does a text get taken up in different social and cultural formations (Couldry: 2000).</p>
<p>Textual analysis of the textual environment is essential as it makes us focus on both texts and readers in a way that may be limited in semiology alone. In other words, “text and readers are co-produced”, and we must explore this relationship (Mackenzie: 2017). Referring back to the Brexit leaflet we can most certainly understand how audiences may interpret this fake news differently. For example, highly educated individuals such university students (and graduates), are exposed to a wide variety of cultures within this space and are likely to be privileged enough to travel overseas as a result of greater financial means. As a consequence, many students (particularly those attuned to dissecting media texts such as media and cultural studies and sociology students) are more likely to recognise the leaflet as problematic propaganda and constituting bias and in-factual fake news. By contrast, individuals of a working class background granted less opportunities and financial means are predisposed to this rhetoric as it works to displace the blame onto immigrants as opposed to the failing, crisis prone economic system and as such are likely to be the intended audience for this text (Owen: 2011). Further still, as higher education is more widely accessed by the middle class population, working class groups have limited access to peer reviewed academic journals and books by comparison. In other words, readers will make their own assumptions about the text because of their own experiences (Clancy: 2014). Similarly, political positions will shape individuals readings, as the audience seeks to reaffirm their pre-existing political standpoint, either using these figures as ammunition for the extreme right-wing vote leave campaign, or dismissing and dismantling the claims from a left-wing perspective. Recognised by Festinger as cognitive dissonance, this social phenomena is a key concept in understanding how audiences operate in the textual environment.<br/>
Moreover, readers from different cultures and countries will interpret this fake news in different ways. I suggest that we should be ‘inside culture’ when we discuss texts in the textual environment, which helps us open our minds about our research. Thus, as the leaflet is about Brexit, British people would engage with it, and by contrast, the Chinese population probably would not have a strong feeling about it.</p>
<p>The above analysis of the textual environment differs from the semiotic analysis of the text, as the “text and readers are conceived as being co-produced within a reading of information”(Couldry 2000: 82). Within semiotic analysis, we could just focus on key signs and relations between them, however it is important to consider the intended audience in the analysis of the textual environment, such as identity aspects including intersections of class, gender, ethnicity and so on. As we have demonstrated, texts are complex and flowing and as such researchers must employ a methodology which has the ability to consider and follow these flows.</p>
