We collected images and recordings from Unilever&#8217;s website homepages, and observed the gradual and dynamical changes of their brand image.</p>
<div class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa">Live methods are a tool and device that allows researchers to re-imagine observation and the generation of alternative forms of research data, and to see the whole without a totalizing perspective. Whilst, it makes sociological craft more artful and crafty (Les Back and Nirmal Puwar: 2012) for our topic, fake news, we need a method able to rethink the relationship between time and the truth. As live methods involve immersion and time, it is a suitable method to analyse Unilever&#8217;s brand image centred on tackling environmental news, therefore we chose this method to display what we discovered about the corporation.</div>

<p>Unilever is a Dutch-British transnational consumer goods company, producing food, beverages, cleaning agents and personal care products.</p>
<p>The homepage of the website in 2006 is chaotic and rambling with nothing emphasized. Multiple bodies of text result in a confusing and busy layout, whilst the choice of colours and imagery look cheap and in hindsight, old fashioned. Although, the top of webpage exhibits the slogan of the Unilever corporation &#8216;feel good, look good, and get more out of life &#8216; clearly and obviously. However, the homepage contains an over abundance of information, making it difficult for the audience to navigate and consequently understand the corporation&#8217;s brand. Featured posts on the homepage include party related information alongside sustainability goals, positioning which arguably undermines the salience of the latter.</p>
<p><strong>Year 2011</strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="237" data-permalink="https://fakenewsproject.wordpress.com/2017/03/19/week-7-live-methods-internet-archives/attachment/2011/" data-orig-file="https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2011.jpg?w=1000" data-orig-size="1360,720" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="2011" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2011.jpg?w=1000?w=300" data-large-file="https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2011.jpg?w=1000?w=1000" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-237" src="https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2011.jpg?w=1000" alt="2011.jpg" srcset="https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2011.jpg?w=1000 1000w, https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2011.jpg?w=150 150w, https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2011.jpg?w=300 300w, https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2011.jpg?w=768 768w, https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2011.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2011.jpg 1360w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"   /></p>
<p>In 2011, the Unilever homepage showcases a nuanced transformation over the past 5 years. Compared to 2006, images now dominate the homepage as text is selectively chosen, concealing the majority of information and focusing on their environmental strategy, here in the form of a &#8216;Green plant&#8217;. The Unilever &#8216;feel good, look good and get more out of life&#8217; slogan is still on the homepage, but positioned outside of the immediate front screen coverage, placing it in a much more inconspicuous place in comparison to 2006. The pictures on the webpage exhibit the diversity of their staff members, connotations of which suggest the company is inclusive and global.</p>
<p>Once again the corporations strives for sustainability maintain a focus on the homepage, with the text suggesting Unilever set &#8216;new global standards&#8217; and as such are a more environmentally conscious corporation that their competitors. At face value, unlike many other companies&#8217; homepages Unilever emphasizes its brand strategy, exemplified by vocabularies choices such as &#8216;responsible&#8217; and &#8216;sustainable&#8217;, rather than pushing the sale of its products and targeting consumers. Thus, one could draw the conclusion that the homepage of this corporation doesn&#8217;t focus on the production, rather it concentrates on the strategy and image of the brand.</p>
<p><strong>Year 2015</strong></p>

<div class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa">In 2015, the homepage of Unilever saw a huge transformation. On the whole, the webpage is simple and succinct. The main background image denotes a wind farm beneath a bright blue sky, coupled with rolling green landscapes and beaming yellow flowers, connotation of which suggest that the company is environmentally conscious, supportive of renewable energy and appreciative of nature. A reading which is further reinforced by the the headline &#8216;We will become &#8216;carbon positive&#8217; in our operations by 2030&#8242;, which is deliberately obvious and striking, written in white with a subtle black transparent background for further emphasis. Even the choice of typeface can be understood as conveying their preferred brand image, as the rounded edges and slightly informal lettering (the &#8216;Y&#8217;, &#8216;U&#8217; and &#8216;V&#8217; in particular) connotes a sense of familiarity, and the child-like playfulness of bubble writing.</div>
<div class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa"></div>
<div class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa">Combined together, the image and headline convince the audience that this corporation is green, and that by choosing their products they will help to improve the environment. Thus reinforcing the view that Unilever believe that profitable growth should also be responsible growth. Furthermore, from the three panels below the headline, we can find two that are directly related to climate action,&#8217;Paul Polaman praises historic Paris Agreement&#8217;, &#8216;Ten ways climate action will drive growth&#8217;, whilst the third appears to focus on making a positive impact more generally. Unilever continues to focus on environmental and sustainability issues emphasizing that it is a environmentally conscious corporation, arguably in order to offset and negative image consumers may have of fast moving consumer goods manufactory.</div>
<div class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa"></div>
<div class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa"></div>
<div class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa"></div>
<div class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa">Our group observed the significant changes of the Unilever homepage from 2006 to 2016. The interaction between users and the webpage has gradually increased due to improved functionality and navigation, whilst the images, bodies of texts, and strategies surrounding the corporation are increasingly stable and observed. Unilever has gradually built a corporate image that purports to concentrate on ultimately becoming a carbon-neutral brand. Although this live method does not provide access to data that would allow us to explore the effects of these changes, we are able to make assumptions based on our own interactions with webpages. However in future studies, we would suggest utilizing more specific data to analyse the effectiveness of Unilever&#8217;s homepage building strategy. Similarly, live methods such as this alone aren&#8217;t able to take into account the reality of the brand presented, such as the Unilever corporation whose environmental impact is not as squeaky clean as they&#8217;d like to admit. In fact, in many cases Unilever&#8217;s products produce direct, negative impacts on the environment through deforestation (in pursuit of palm oil), air pollution, and in the case of Kodiakanal, mercury poisoning of an entire tourist town to which Unilever was charged with &#8216;corporate negligence&#8217; (See links below).</div>
<div class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa"></div>
<div class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa">
<p>Hence, Unilever&#8217;s sustainable and environmentally conscious brand image could be understood as nothing more than corporate green washing, as in spite of their eco-brand  image exemplified by their online homepages since 2006, in this time Unilever has contributed to a myriad of environmental sins, with their pursuit of palm oil presenting itself as the most pertinent (Rogers: 2015). Palm oil is an incredibly cheap and profitable vegetable oil found in an unbelievable amount of food and edible oil products. Despite the oil&#8217;s affordability, its extraction possesses extensive social and environmental costs, as indigenous human and endangered animal populations (orang-utan&#8217;s in particular) are forced off their land in corporate land grabs, to make way for the mass deforestation required to produce palm oil. Further still, the tropical peat stores within low laying forest grounds store far more carbon than others, ergo when these areas are burned and felled for palm oil the emissions released hold devastating immediate impacts on the surrounding environment, in addition to the long term contributions to global anthropogenic climate change. Effects which are exemplified by WWF&#8217;s assertion that &#8216;Indonesia&#8217;s high deforestation rate&#8217; (due to palm oil production) &#8216;has made it the third-largest global emitter of greenhouse gases&#8217;, demonstrating the severity of palm oil production and calling into question Unilever&#8217;s eco-friendly image as a historical producer, and continued user of palm oil in the majority of its products (See link below).</p>
<p>There is therefore an underlying irony in Unilever&#8217;s decision to maintain a brand focus on issues surrounding the environment and sustainability which may not be uncovered using live methods alone, demonstrating the salience of a methodology able to explore beyond the visual branding itself.</p>

<p><span style="color:#3366ff;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;"><strong>Method</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;"><strong>Multi-sited ethnographical study of journalists in China and UK</strong> </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;">Participant observation lasting a month </span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;">Semi-structured interviews with journalists conducted at the end of the observations when rapport has been built up sufficiently</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;">Textual a</span></b><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;"><strong>nalysis of the media outlets explored during the ethnography</strong> </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;">Sample of 2 weeks’ worth of the news media institutions (the same institutions explored ethnographically at the same time) output across platforms so as to see if it makes if these cross-platform formats impact the content quality </span></li>
</ul>
<p><em><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;"> </span></em></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;"><em>(Bringing it all together – after a month the group would reconvene with their findings and continue with a deeper data analysis)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#3366ff;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;"> Rationale</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;">The portfolio brought our research project to natural conclusion and focus on issues surrounding politics, multiculturalism and the environment, issues which pervade national boarders and impact nations across the globe. Thus, as different group members can offer <span style="font-family:Calibri;">multiple cultural perspectives due to a mix of British and Chinese researchers</span>, we decided to use these invaluable cultural insights and conduct a multi-sited research project, exploring fake news in both Britain and China. A multi-sited study is arguably imperative, as fake news is likely to differ immensely in content, focus and style across different spaces and cultures, and should therefore be explored on an international level. Similarly, in an age of mass-communication and globalization where news information can be transported around the world in a second, it is essential that the methods we employ have the ability to follow these flows in a similar fashion.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;">It should be noted that the researchers conducting the ethnographic studies </span></span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;">will also be citizens of these countries so as to ensure that as researchers we do not misrepresent nations overseas. Further still, beyond avoiding theoretical implications, ensuring that the ethnographic research is only conducted by those familiar with the space, logistical issues are also avoided, such as language barriers, visas and accommodation etc. Hence, the presence of four researchers is incredibly useful, as it allows multiple methods to be explored simultaneously (reducing the amount of time and funding required) as each member can work on a different project and bring a different insight and perspective to the collective research project. Bhambra reinforces the salience of research which takes into account other cultures and histories, often erased from the social sciences as a consequence of ‘Eurocentrism’ (2009). </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;">Furthermore, the two researchers not conducting the ethnographical studies would conduct the textual analysis, as this would ensure that the researcher is not to heavily involved in the media institution itself as a result of building a rapport with its producers over time, and will be able to take a step back from the media text more easily. The textual analysis will explore the British and Chinese institutions media output over a two week timeframe, producing research to accompany the participant observation within the institutions themselves. However, due to issues surrounding access and gatekeepers, there is ambiguity surrounding which specific news outlets we would be investigating. Yet such an insight would provide a thorough and in depth snapshot of the given institutions and may uncover how they avoid fake news, or reinforce it. Similarly, by coupling media and empirical research methods together, the data will be able to discover beyond what is produced and explore why and how news is produced in a particular way.</span></p>

<p>An interesting blog post on the topic of fake news written from the perspective of a professor in critical theory. It challenges the idea fake news can be opposed by truth. Firstly just because something is true and well argued does not mean it will have a greater impact then something false, which is well argued. Fake news is powerful because it mobilizes affects, affects already imbedded in our ideology. The opposition is for the author not between true and false but between affects such as fear and hope. the article therefore gives an explanation as to why despite all of his false claims, the truth did not undermine Donald Trumps presidential campaign.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/fakenewsproject.wordpress.com/148/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/fakenewsproject.wordpress.com/148/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fakenewsproject.wordpress.com&#038;blog=125057479&#038;post=148&#038;subd=fakenewsproject&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The following article written by Laurie Penny (2017) for the New Statesman discusses the link between advertising and journalism, and its significance in propelling fake news into public consciousness. Furthermore, Laurie highlights Trumps success in using ambiguous news media outlets to his advantage.</em></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Fake news generates clicks because people click on things that they want to believe. Clicks lead to ad revenue, and ad revenue is currently all that is sustaining a media industry in crisis&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The rise of bullshit, from George Orwell to Donald Trump.</strong></p>
<p>When is a lie not a lie? Recently, the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> reported that university students had demanded that “philosophers such as Plato and Kant” be “removed from [the] syllabus because they are white”. Other outlets followed suit, wringing their hands over the censoriousness of today’s uninquiring young minds. The article generated an extraordinary amount of consternation click bait. Angry responses were written and hot takes were quick-fried and served up by outlets anxious  to join the dinner rush of  ad-friendly disapproval.</p>
<p>It’s a story that could have been designed to press every outrage button of the political-correctness-gone-mad brigade. It has students trying to ban things, an apparent lack of respect for independent thought and reverse racism. It seemed too good to be true.</p>
<p>And it was. In reality, what happened was far less interesting: the student union of the School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas) at the University of London had proposed that “the majority of philosophers on our courses” be from Asia and Africa, and that the Western greats be approached from a “critical standpoint”. Some might consider this a reasonable request, given that critical analysis is a component of most philosophy courses, and Soas has a long tradition of promoting the study of the global South. Yet a story about students declaring Kant irrelevant allows the <em>Telegraph</em> to despair for the youth of today and permits advertisers to profit from that despair.</p>
<p>People didn’t start pumping out this stuff because they decided to abandon journalistic ethics. They did so because such principles are hugely expensive and a hard sell. Even those of us who create and consume news can forget that the news is a commodity – a commodity with a business model behind it, subsidised by advertising. Rigorous, investigative, nuanced content, the sort that pays attention to objective facts and fosters serious public debate, is expensive to create. Talk, however, is cheap.</p>
<p>Fake news sells because fake news is what people want to be true. Fake news generates clicks because people click on things that they want to believe. Clicks lead to ad revenue, and ad revenue is currently all that is sustaining a media industry in crisis. Journalism is casting about for new funding models as if for handholds on a sheer cliff. This explains a great deal about the position in which we find ourselves as citizens in this toxic public sphere.</p>
<p>What has this got to do with Donald Trump? A great deal. This sticky, addictive spread of fake news has fostered a climate of furious, fact-free reaction.</p>
<p>Press outlets give millions of dollars of free coverage to Trump without him having to send out a single press release. The reality TV star is the small-fingered god of good copy. The stories write themselves. Now, the stories are about the threat to the future of journalism from the man who has just entered the Oval Office.</p>
<div class="article-mpu-5"></div>
<p>Trump’s first press conference in six months, held at Trump Tower in New York on 11 January, was – by any measure – extraordinary. He did not merely refuse to answer questions about unverified allegations that he had been “cultivated” by Russia. He lost his temper spectacularly with the assembled press, declaring: “You’re fake news! And <em>you’re</em> fake news!”</p>
<p>Trump did not mean that the journalists were lying. His attitude to the press is straight from the Kremlin’s playbook: rather than refute individual accusations, he attempts to discredit the notion of truth in journalism. The free press is a check on power, and Trump likes his power unchecked.</p>
<p>Writing in the Guardian in 2015, Peter Pomarantsev noted of Putin’s propaganda strategy that “these efforts constitute a kind of linguistic sabotage of the infrastructure of reason: if the very possibility of rational argument is submerged in a fog of uncertainty, there are no grounds for debate – and the public can be expected to decide that there is no point in trying to decide the winner, or even bothering to listen.”</p>
<p>If people lose trust in the media’s capacity to report facts, they begin to rely on what “feels” true, and the influence rests with whomever can capitalise on those feelings. Donald Trump and his team know this. Trump doesn’t tell it like it is. Instead, he tells it like it feels, and that’s far more effective.</p>
<p>Fake news – or “bullshit”, as the American philosopher Harry G Frankfurt termed it in a 2005 essay – has never been weaponised to this extent, but it is nothing new. George Orwell anticipated the trend in the 1930s, looking back on the Spanish Civil War. “The very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world,” he wrote. “Lies will pass into history . . . In Spain, for the first time, I saw newspaper reports which did not bear any relation to the facts, not even the relationship which is implied in an ordinary lie . . . In the past people deliberately lied, or they unconsciously coloured what they wrote, or they struggled after the truth, well knowing that they must make many mistakes; but in each case they believed that ‘facts’ existed and were more or less discoverable.”</p>
<p>Fake news – or “bullshit”, as the American philosopher Harry G Frankfurt termed it in a 2005 essay – has never been weaponised to this extent, but it is nothing new.

<p>This is the real danger of fake news, and it is compounded by a lingering assumption of good faith on the part of those who believe in journalistic principle. After all, it’s impossible to prove that a person intended to deceive, and that they didn’t believe at the time that what they said was true. Trump may believe in whatever “facts” he has decided are convenient that day. When he insists that he never mocked a disabled reporter, whatever video evidence may exist to the contrary, he may believe it. Is it, then, a lie?</p>
<p>Of course it’s a lie. People who have no respect for the concept of truth are still capable of lies. However, they are also capable of bullshit – bullshit being a register that rubbishes the entire notion of objective reality by deeming it irrelevant. The only possible response is to insist, and keep insisting, that the truth still means something.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/fakenewsproject.wordpress.com/94/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/fakenewsproject.wordpress.com/94/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fakenewsproject.wordpress.com&#038;blog=125057479&#038;post=94&#038;subd=fakenewsproject&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although in theory a rigorously defined research programme is desirable and a nice idea, when it comes to under taking research in practice, especially in the social sciences, it is not always possible and indeed it may inhibit the full exploration of a given topic. Regarding our own research on the subject of fake news, a topic none of us had researched previously, we were unsure what information and materials would be available to us. We have therefore put together a<span class="text_exposed_show"> portfolio that includes a range of different topics and stories that come under the general heading of fake news. Thus the next step in our research will be to connect these seemingly disparate topics, forming a montage that will provide a useful means of disciplining and understanding the data. Indeed following Crang&#8217;s thinking and analysis are not purely theoretical models in our heads, but they involve the manipulation of a range of material confined to specific locations. This means we need to start with the organisation of our materials. </span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">This physical organisation of the various fake news articles aids the development of thinking and interpreting the data. For this task the online blog is particularly useful as it allows for the literal manipulation and mapping out of the various materials. Additionally, the blog provides an interactive space in which the members of the group are able to think with one another with the use of this interactive interface, our task is to make the data intelligible in the form of a montage. In film montages are ways of editing and telling stories outside of temporal constraints, in this way the fake news on the blog can be read as individual montages. But additionally we are able to create a larger montage out of the self-contained montages that are the individual instances of fake news. In this way we create a montage out of montages. </span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>In light of the messy process of gathering information and the method of the montage, the narrative that has unintentionally emerged from our portfolio is one that centres around politics, often centred around but not limited to the fake news stories surrounding Donald trump and climate change. In addition, our portfolio contains stories that link both president Trump and climate change, not least as he famously remarked climate change is a hoax created by the Liberal Democrat politicians and China.<br />
Perhaps our montage has revealed these topics as the prevailing and connecting themes  as a result of the American presidential campaign that brought fake news into the public eye. Indeed the link provided bellow suggests that fake news or ‘alternative facts’ are embraced by the Trump administration.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSrEEDQgFc8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#0066cc;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSrEEDQgFc8</span></a></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="id_58cc21fc61c744272980128" class="text_exposed_root text_exposed">
<p>However, there is a need for deeper analysis and new ways of approaching the topic of fake news<i>,</i> I have consequently considered how we could approach the subject of fake news using Baudrillard and the article on Spinoza in the discussion below.</p>
<p>Following Baudrillard, fake news could be read as a symptom generated by the hyper real&#8230; Hyper-reality being a world in which the lack of the real,<span class="text_exposed_show"> is covered up by a paranoiac over production of simulacra (signs that do not seek to represent the real) (1981). Baudrillard raises an interesting point regarding Disney land. Disney land functions in so far as it pretends to be outside of normality, a fictional world (1981). In this way it covers up the fact the wider society is just as hyper real. Perhaps this logic could be applied to fake news, as hyper reality dissolves oppositions such as true and false. Perhaps fake news can be read as sustaining the illusion that the opposition between true and false is a meaningful distinction in a world saturated by simulacra. Additionally, following the article that reads fake news through Spinoza, this reading may provide a critique of fake news that does not fall into the largely meaningless debate concerning the truth. Events such as climate change, the election of Donald trump (a proven liar) and the proliferation of fake news suggests we cant appose untruth with truth alone. But again following the Spinoza text, the affects fake news produces must be and can be challenged by alternative affects. Also I suggest caution with the Baudrilardian reading in so far as we can not give up on the distinction between true and false entirely, as fake news is predicated on this opposition. </span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">We can take two directions, either give up on the distinction between real and fake news, or consider Baudrillards theory as a partial one, a useful tool for challenging oppositions, but by no means a totalising theory. In other words reading Baudrillards theory of simulacra as documenting a process whereby more and more of reality becomes hyper real, which results in an increased disorientation regarding distinctions such as true and false, real and fake. But by no means totally forecloses the possibility of these categories having some validity. In this way perhaps the truth needs to be supplemented with affect, as time and time again it would appear affect is far more powerful than the notion of the truth in a post truth or hyper real society. Following the reflections on week 2 I would like to suggest fake news demands engaging with more philosophical questions in media and cultural studies in contrast to Couldrys claim, that media and cultural studies does not need to address these things(2000).</span></p>

<div class="main_article_text ">
<p><b>It looks like Facebook&#8217;s problem with fake news has kicked off a war inside the tech firm.</b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/sheerafrenkel/renegade-facebook-employees-form-task-force-to-battle-fake-n?utm_term=.po6d5dy20#.cwz7X7mBY"><span style="color:#0066cc;">Buzzfeed News is reporting</span></a> that &#8220;more than dozens&#8221; of staff have created an unofficial task force to sort out the problem.</p>
<p>The key issue is that it&#8217;s not always immediately obvious which news isn&#8217;t real.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s difficult for people scrolling through Facebook quickly, often on small mobile screens, to get a sense of what&#8217;s real and what isn&#8217;t,&#8221; says Claire Wardle, from the Tow Center for Digital Journalism.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not surprising that Facebook is struggling more with fake news, as there&#8217;s more of it being produced,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<div class="pullOut quote">
<div class="quotetext">For many, carefully-constructed fake news is actually preferable to some of the utter garbage churned out by mainstream news</div>
<div class="quoter">
<div class="name">Southend News Network</div>
<div class="title"></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Earlier this week, Facebook said it was going to do more to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37967783"><span style="color:#0066cc;">tackle the problem</span></a> of made-up news, some of it intended as comedy, which people then shared.</p>
<p>Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said &#8220;only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes&#8221; and denied Facebook played a role in Donald Trump&#8217;s surprise election victory. &#8220;The idea that fake news on Facebook influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2>Here are some examples of fake or spoof news that you may have shared</h2>
<p>A spoof response to a story about Lego pulling its adverts from the Daily Mail&#8230;</p>
<div class="image_container "><img src="https://i0.wp.com/ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/CB91/production/_92431125_southendnewsnetwork.jpg" alt="southend news network posted about the Daily Mail and Lego" /></div>
<p>One of the main news sites publishing spoof stories says it&#8217;s actually providing a service.</p>
<p>&#8220;The world in 2016 is a messed-up place in a number of ways, and for many people carefully-constructed fake news is actually preferable to some of the utter garbage that is churned out by the mainstream news websites,&#8221; Southend News Network wrote <a href="http://southendnewsnetwork.com/news/dear-mark-zuckerberg-an-open-letter-from-southend-news-network/"><span style="color:#0066cc;">in an open letter</span></a>.</p>
<p>Its &#8220;About&#8221; section states that it has &#8220;no real aims or objectives in mind other than to add a satirical/spoof-like touch to issues that people are passionate about.&#8221;</p>
<h2>You probably spotted this one was not real news&#8230;</h2>
<p>Not least because the author is &#8220;Doug Trench&#8221;.</p>
<div class="image_container "><img src="https://i2.wp.com/ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/140C1/production/_92431128_toblerone.jpg" alt="A spoof story about toblerone" /></div>
<p>Southend News Network says it&#8217;s catering to a market that actively wants fake news.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we are saying is that any decision that you make has to take into account that for every user who hates fake news websites, there is someone else who is so disillusioned with the whole stinking mess, that they use these as an escape and a bit of a giggle.&#8221;</p>
<h2>We sincerely doubt Canada&#8217;s leader would give this scoop to the Rochdale Herald&#8230;</h2>
<div class="image_container "><img src="https://i1.wp.com/ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/68BD/production/_92431862_rochadaleheardal.jpg" alt="Rochdale Herald" /></div>
<h2>And did you or your friends share this Donald Trump quote from 1998? It&#8217;s fake</h2>
<div class="image_container "><img src="https://i0.wp.com/ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D092/production/_92449335_trumppeople1998.jpg" alt="Fake Trump quote" /></div>
<p>Spotting fake news may seem obvious &#8211; if it seems a little bit unbelievable, it probably is.</p>
<p>Satirical sites like The Rochdale Herald, the Suffolk Gazette and the Daily Mash often mimic real ones and look the same.</p>
<p>But a quick check of bylines &#8211; the writer&#8217;s name &#8211; can swiftly tell you it&#8217;s all meant as a joke. The above examples are penned by a Doug Trench and a Sebastian Wiesel.</p>
<p>In a disclaimer, another site &#8211; the Suffolk Advertiser &#8211; asks for stories to be submitted but &#8220;nothing libellous, abusive, racist, sexist, generally offensive&#8221; and it &#8220;must be remotely funny and not get us into trouble&#8221;.</p>
<p>Facebook says it&#8217;s going to announce how it plans to differentiate real news from fake ones soon.</p>
<p>It says that only 1% of news shares on Facebook are fake.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week ethnography is the main method, which means writing, drawing and telling peoples stories, phenomena and networks. This method normally focuses on one case or place, which is called a “field site”. A field site is a place where an ethnographer does “fieldwork”(Mackenzie: 2017) and as our project focuses on fake news, it makes sense that ethnography could be a useful method, as we can observe how audiences make sense of fake news in particular media spaces and how fake news affects them in their social and cultural context.</p>
<p>Ethnography maintains that it is important to consider digital platforms in addition to physical field sites in modern society. Particularly as most people now access news stories and information in cyberspace, and in many cases on social media platforms such as <strong>Facebook, </strong>whom withhold the capacity to circulate fake news. Thus for ethnographers, it is a crucial field site for exploring fake news, especially as social media facilitates further sharing and interaction amongst audience members. However, <strong>online/offline worlds need to coexistent in the group research. </strong>Studying objects, like people or the news, can help reveal differences or draw comparisons between different forms of places. Hence, multisided ethnography would be an appropriate method for researching spaces such as those noted during initial group discussions which included; Facebook, newsrooms and Buddhist temples.</p>
<p><strong>Place: Fake news groups on Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>People I want to meet and talk and spend time with:</strong> Fake news group members</p>
<p>By locating fake news posts on Facebook, we could find out how people make sense of these forms of news by engaging with the group and participating in the sharing and discussion of fake news. Interviewing readers would also be a key component in this research method and later comparisons could be drawn by looking at the responses of individuals from different generations—young people and middle-aged people, for instance—and educational backgrounds (professors and domestic workers). In interviews, questions could include,</p>
<p>l  What fake news these people are interested in?</p>
<p>l  Why are these people interested in fake news?</p>
<p>l  How they normally read the fake news?</p>
<p>Also, by setting up a group research Facebook page within the field site itself, we are able to “access into subcultures, niche social movement, and marginal/vulnerable groups” with greater ease than ever before (Murthy, 2010,p.25). Especially as gatekeepers are minimal and a wide variety of the population use Facebook, producing a rich sample site.</p>

<p><strong>Place: Paul Horner Facebook page</strong></p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.facebook.com/IAmPaulHornerBowDown/" rel="nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/IAmPaulHornerBowDown/</a>)</p>
<p><strong>People I want to meet and spend time with: Pawl Horner, fake news writer</strong></p>
<p>While conducting research focused on fake news, Pawl Horner cannot be ignored. He arguably withheld an enormous impact on the 2016 U.S. presidential election as he wrote and circulated an abundance of fake news stories, including “Donald Trump Requiring All To wear Badges” and “President Obama Signs Executive Order Banning The National Anthem” (Inside edition, 2016). Questionable actions which in fact made him a lot of money,” about $10,000 a month” (Inside edition: 2016).</p>
<p><em>“When a lot of people read those stories he gets a certain amount of money for each person that clicks through and that adds up to a lot of money” </em>(Inside edition: 2016).</p>
<p>Hence interviewing Horner would provide an indispensable insight into the motivations of fake news producers and uncover whether the financial incentives are the driving force, or if as Horner insists, fake news seeks to provide satire in an increasingly media saturated world. In this interview, I would focus on questions:</p>
<p>l  Does writing fake news become a new job now?</p>
<p>l  From Horner’s point of view, why are there so many people like reading the fake news?</p>

<p><strong>P</strong></p>
<p><strong>lace : The Guardian Newsroom</strong></p>
<p><strong>People I want to meet and spend time with: Journalists of The Guardian</strong></p>
<p>In terms of physical places, firstly, there are newsrooms, the Guardian, for example. The phenomenon of fake news is incredibly popular, to the extent that the concept of “post-truth” is now being used to describe the current political climate (Wang: 2016). However, under these circumstances the reaction of traditional media such as newspapers is important. Hence, during an ethnographical study I would observe how reputable journalists and news editors examine their own daily news, before delivering it to the public as this would provide a valuable insight into the dynamics of news production and how fake news is avoided in large institutions. Whilst also listening and talking to this group about how they feel about fake news in their own everyday lives, could also provide an interesting insight. Furthermore, this insight could uncover ways in which readers could detect what is fake news themselves.</p>
<p>It should be noted that during one-to-one interviews, it is imperative that sound recording devices are used to collect data, as it allows for a more natural exchange of conversation and ensures interviewees are not misquoted, perhaps demonstrating a method journalists might use to minimise the potential of their own stories to produce fake news.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Place: A Buddhist temple </strong></p>
<p><strong>People I want to meet and spend time with: Monks in the temple whom may not encounter or be aware of the fake news.</strong></p>
<p>Finally, exploring a Buddhist temple could be an extreme example, as it is often assumed that monks living in temples will not be allowed to use social media and thus will not encounter fake news. Yet, Pecorella (2016) notes in the article, <em>Buddhism and Social Media: The 21st Century Monk</em>, Buddhist monks could use the Internet and get information on Facebook. Although research opportunities may be limited as it is not easy to access to a temple, there are however Buddhist monk groups on Facebook (See figure 3), which means interviewing them on internet-based platforms could be possible. Nevertheless, it would be better to go to a real temple if possible, so as to explore the differences in how monks react to fake news in different places(online/offline) as a group often assumed to not be immersed in media. The main questions I would ask include:</p>
<p>l  Could they know how to distinguish what news is true or fake?</p>
<p>l  Does fake news affect them? If yes, how? If not, why?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we had a very interesting discussion surrounding the use of discourse analysis to explore Fake News. Discourse may be understood in the Foucauldian sense as a &#8216;structuring structure&#8217; which produces systems of meaning, which shape our knowledge and consequent practices. Foucault&#8217;s (2002) work on discourse and its widespread power influenced the work of many theorists, including Edward Said a theorist also discussed briefly in week 3 (1991). Said&#8217;s concept of Orientalism (1991) provides an exquisite exemplar of how discourse analysis may be applied to uncover understandings which are at first hidden or taken for granted. Adapting Foucauldian discourse, Said applied the method of analysis to a vast array of literature of the &#8216;Orient&#8217;, predominantly produced by writers from the West constituting a &#8216;hermetic history&#8217; (1991: 23). Said found that despite spatial and temporal differences, the literature consistently constructed the East as a dangerous and backward place, with a violent and uneducated population (1991). Further still, those residing in the East unable to represent themselves in these texts were constructed as an absolute &#8216;other&#8217; too Westerners, through dichotomous understandings such as tradition/cosmopolitanism and religion/secularism. Such understandings work to reassert notions of the Western identity which may be recognised as a discursive formation, often unseen and difficult to define when not in relation to others. That said, mutually supporting constructions constituting an Orientalist discourse may be witnessed across all media platforms today, demonstrating the salience of  self-representation.</p>
<p>As demonstrated by Said and others, discourse analysis offers unlimited exploration which is well suited to the study of fake news, as just as discourses are omnipresent, operating across all media platforms, spaces and time, so is the phenomenon of fake news. If we consider an analysis of fake news in 2017 without an application of discourse analysis, we risk missing the immense history of propaganda, and the multiple levels of misinformation within the media throughout history. Thus, during group discussions we concluded that this method would be highly applicable and useful in this context, as fake news is evident across all media platforms and institutions, and therefore requires a method of analysis able to explore this wide variety of sources, uncovering similarities and differences. Furthermore, through a Foucauldian discourse analysis we may understand the discurs<span class="text_exposed_show">ive construction of the truth as imperative for the functioning of democracy, which consequently shapes our understanding of fake news as a potentially destructive force. Without the given methodology this common sense understanding would be particularly difficult to uncover and explain due to our own situating within the context, rendering the discursive formation invisible to us.</span></p>

<p>Initial group discussions of fake news considered the concepts of simulacra, the hyper-real and the notion of the spectacle (Baudrillard: 1988/ 1983) (Debord: 1994), in relation to post truth politics and the Trump campaign. Suggesting that the obesity of information may reduce the level of reflexivity and consequently allows Fake News stories to circulate more freely online. Baudrillard refers to this implosion of information as an &#8216;ecstasy&#8217; of communication, through which less real communication actually occurs (Baudrillard: 1988). This paradox is highly applicable to the issue of fake news, as it is not in the absence of &#8216;real&#8217; news that fake news proliferates, but in the overabundance of news itself. Leading the masses to become apathetic and the political arena &#8216;vacuous&#8217; and &#8217;empty&#8217;, arguably demonstrated by the American publics suicidal election of Trump, a man with virtually no experience but the ability to produce a marvellous spectacle  (Baudrillard 1988: 110). A similar understanding could be applied to Britains decision to leave the European Union and seek independence.</p>
<p>For example, if we apply a discourse analysis to the image below we are able to uncover various hidden meanings previously concealed.</p>

<p>At face value the image merely denotes a white male assumed to be a politician, fighting emotively for a country he cares deeply about. Farage, open mouthed in mid-speech clings to a board which reads, &#8216;We want our country back Vote to Leave&#8217; standing in front of a large screen which reiterates the same statement in capitalised form &#8216;WE WANT OUR COUNTRY BACK&#8217; (mirroring visually Baudrillard&#8217;s obesity of information) , implying that the country from which he belongs has been taken over by someone else, and yet this is far from the case. Without an application of discourse analysis there is much that an audience may take for granted here, such as the history of colonial conquest inscribed upon Farage&#8217;s treasured nation. Furthermore, the emotionally charged text and image reproduce an anti-immigration discourse, characterised by the discursive entity of national identity and nationhood, which creates imaginary boarders where there are physically none.</p>
<p>Anti-immigration discourses such as that connoted in this image rely on the erasure of the historical slave labour and colonialism, which aided the industrial revolution producing the modern nation recognised today, from the collective consciousness of the British public (Bhambra: 2009). Hence, an ironic undertone may be recognised within this image, as the majority of nations overseas annually celebrate independence from Britain, and yet Mr. Farage purports that it British nationals themselves who must seek independence, as if joining in a peaceful union with our neighbouring countries (Europe) following the death of millions during WW&#8217;s constitutes a loss of our country&#8217;s nationhood, akin to the brutal and bloody imperialism we historically inflicted on over a quarter of the worlds population (Bhambra: 2009). Further still, Farage&#8217;s position of privilege as a white, heterosexual, middle class male endows him with power to make such claims. However, it should be noted that such a reading requires the audience to possess a knowledge of imperialism and inequality, and as such it is unlikely that all audience members would recognise the discursive entities at play here. Regardless, discourse analysis is essential for &#8216;showing seeing&#8217; as it withholds the power to structure how things are thought and our consequent actions (Mitchell: 2002).</p>
<p>However, the question still remains, does the image above constitute fake news as a result of its ignorance, or does its visual construction of anti-immigration discourse merely mirror the very real discursive entity of nationhood shaping Britain today? Nations may be socially constructed, but does that make them &#8216;unreal&#8217; and fake in the everyday lives of the wider public?</p>
