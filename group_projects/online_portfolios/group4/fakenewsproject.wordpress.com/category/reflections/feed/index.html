We collected images and recordings from Unilever&#8217;s website homepages, and observed the gradual and dynamical changes of their brand image.</p>
<div class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa">Live methods are a tool and device that allows researchers to re-imagine observation and the generation of alternative forms of research data, and to see the whole without a totalizing perspective. Whilst, it makes sociological craft more artful and crafty (Les Back and Nirmal Puwar: 2012) for our topic, fake news, we need a method able to rethink the relationship between time and the truth. As live methods involve immersion and time, it is a suitable method to analyse Unilever&#8217;s brand image centred on tackling environmental news, therefore we chose this method to display what we discovered about the corporation.</div>

<p>Unilever is a Dutch-British transnational consumer goods company, producing food, beverages, cleaning agents and personal care products.</p>
<p>The homepage of the website in 2006 is chaotic and rambling with nothing emphasized. Multiple bodies of text result in a confusing and busy layout, whilst the choice of colours and imagery look cheap and in hindsight, old fashioned. Although, the top of webpage exhibits the slogan of the Unilever corporation &#8216;feel good, look good, and get more out of life &#8216; clearly and obviously. However, the homepage contains an over abundance of information, making it difficult for the audience to navigate and consequently understand the corporation&#8217;s brand. Featured posts on the homepage include party related information alongside sustainability goals, positioning which arguably undermines the salience of the latter.</p>
<p><strong>Year 2011</strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="237" data-permalink="https://fakenewsproject.wordpress.com/2017/03/19/week-7-live-methods-internet-archives/attachment/2011/" data-orig-file="https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2011.jpg?w=1000" data-orig-size="1360,720" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="2011" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2011.jpg?w=1000?w=300" data-large-file="https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2011.jpg?w=1000?w=1000" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-237" src="https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2011.jpg?w=1000" alt="2011.jpg" srcset="https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2011.jpg?w=1000 1000w, https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2011.jpg?w=150 150w, https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2011.jpg?w=300 300w, https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2011.jpg?w=768 768w, https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2011.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2011.jpg 1360w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"   /></p>
<p>In 2011, the Unilever homepage showcases a nuanced transformation over the past 5 years. Compared to 2006, images now dominate the homepage as text is selectively chosen, concealing the majority of information and focusing on their environmental strategy, here in the form of a &#8216;Green plant&#8217;. The Unilever &#8216;feel good, look good and get more out of life&#8217; slogan is still on the homepage, but positioned outside of the immediate front screen coverage, placing it in a much more inconspicuous place in comparison to 2006. The pictures on the webpage exhibit the diversity of their staff members, connotations of which suggest the company is inclusive and global.</p>
<p>Once again the corporations strives for sustainability maintain a focus on the homepage, with the text suggesting Unilever set &#8216;new global standards&#8217; and as such are a more environmentally conscious corporation that their competitors. At face value, unlike many other companies&#8217; homepages Unilever emphasizes its brand strategy, exemplified by vocabularies choices such as &#8216;responsible&#8217; and &#8216;sustainable&#8217;, rather than pushing the sale of its products and targeting consumers. Thus, one could draw the conclusion that the homepage of this corporation doesn&#8217;t focus on the production, rather it concentrates on the strategy and image of the brand.</p>
<p><strong>Year 2015</strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="238" data-permalink="https://fakenewsproject.wordpress.com/2017/03/19/week-7-live-methods-internet-archives/attachment/2015/" data-orig-file="https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2015.jpg?w=1000" data-orig-size="1365,720" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="2015" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2015.jpg?w=1000?w=300" data-large-file="https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2015.jpg?w=1000?w=1000" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-238" src="https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2015.jpg?w=1000" alt="2015.jpg" srcset="https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2015.jpg?w=1000 1000w, https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2015.jpg?w=150 150w, https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2015.jpg?w=300 300w, https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2015.jpg?w=768 768w, https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2015.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2015.jpg 1365w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"   /></p>
<div class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa">In 2015, the homepage of Unilever saw a huge transformation. On the whole, the webpage is simple and succinct. The main background image denotes a wind farm beneath a bright blue sky, coupled with rolling green landscapes and beaming yellow flowers, connotation of which suggest that the company is environmentally conscious, supportive of renewable energy and appreciative of nature. A reading which is further reinforced by the the headline &#8216;We will become &#8216;carbon positive&#8217; in our operations by 2030&#8242;, which is deliberately obvious and striking, written in white with a subtle black transparent background for further emphasis. Even the choice of typeface can be understood as conveying their preferred brand image, as the rounded edges and slightly informal lettering (the &#8216;Y&#8217;, &#8216;U&#8217; and &#8216;V&#8217; in particular) connotes a sense of familiarity, and the child-like playfulness of bubble writing.</div>
<div class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa"></div>
<div class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa">Combined together, the image and headline convince the audience that this corporation is green, and that by choosing their products they will help to improve the environment. Thus reinforcing the view that Unilever believe that profitable growth should also be responsible growth. Furthermore, from the three panels below the headline, we can find two that are directly related to climate action,&#8217;Paul Polaman praises historic Paris Agreement&#8217;, &#8216;Ten ways climate action will drive growth&#8217;, whilst the third appears to focus on making a positive impact more generally. Unilever continues to focus on environmental and sustainability issues emphasizing that it is a environmentally conscious corporation, arguably in order to offset and negative image consumers may have of fast moving consumer goods manufactory.</div>
<div class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa"></div>
<div class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa"></div>
<div class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa"></div>
<div class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa">Our group observed the significant changes of the Unilever homepage from 2006 to 2016. The interaction between users and the webpage has gradually increased due to improved functionality and navigation, whilst the images, bodies of texts, and strategies surrounding the corporation are increasingly stable and observed. Unilever has gradually built a corporate image that purports to concentrate on ultimately becoming a carbon-neutral brand. Although this live method does not provide access to data that would allow us to explore the effects of these changes, we are able to make assumptions based on our own interactions with webpages. However in future studies, we would suggest utilizing more specific data to analyse the effectiveness of Unilever&#8217;s homepage building strategy. Similarly, live methods such as this alone aren&#8217;t able to take into account the reality of the brand presented, such as the Unilever corporation whose environmental impact is not as squeaky clean as they&#8217;d like to admit. In fact, in many cases Unilever&#8217;s products produce direct, negative impacts on the environment through deforestation (in pursuit of palm oil), air pollution, and in the case of Kodiakanal, mercury poisoning of an entire tourist town to which Unilever was charged with &#8216;corporate negligence&#8217; (See links below).</div>
<div class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa"></div>
<div class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa">
<p>Hence, Unilever&#8217;s sustainable and environmentally conscious brand image could be understood as nothing more than corporate green washing, as in spite of their eco-brand  image exemplified by their online homepages since 2006, in this time Unilever has contributed to a myriad of environmental sins, with their pursuit of palm oil presenting itself as the most pertinent (Rogers: 2015). Palm oil is an incredibly cheap and profitable vegetable oil found in an unbelievable amount of food and edible oil products. Despite the oil&#8217;s affordability, its extraction possesses extensive social and environmental costs, as indigenous human and endangered animal populations (orang-utan&#8217;s in particular) are forced off their land in corporate land grabs, to make way for the mass deforestation required to produce palm oil. Further still, the tropical peat stores within low laying forest grounds store far more carbon than others, ergo when these areas are burned and felled for palm oil the emissions released hold devastating immediate impacts on the surrounding environment, in addition to the long term contributions to global anthropogenic climate change. Effects which are exemplified by WWF&#8217;s assertion that &#8216;Indonesia&#8217;s high deforestation rate&#8217; (due to palm oil production) &#8216;has made it the third-largest global emitter of greenhouse gases&#8217;, demonstrating the severity of palm oil production and calling into question Unilever&#8217;s eco-friendly image as a historical producer, and continued user of palm oil in the majority of its products (See link below).</p>
<p>There is therefore an underlying irony in Unilever&#8217;s decision to maintain a brand focus on issues surrounding the environment and sustainability which may not be uncovered using live methods alone, demonstrating the salience of a methodology able to explore beyond the visual branding itself.</p>

<p><span style="color:#3366ff;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;"><strong>Method</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;"><strong>Multi-sited ethnographical study of journalists in China and UK</strong> </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;">Participant observation lasting a month </span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;">Semi-structured interviews with journalists conducted at the end of the observations when rapport has been built up sufficiently</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;">Textual a</span></b><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;"><strong>nalysis of the media outlets explored during the ethnography</strong> </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;">Sample of 2 weeks’ worth of the news media institutions (the same institutions explored ethnographically at the same time) output across platforms so as to see if it makes if these cross-platform formats impact the content quality </span></li>
</ul>
<p><em><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;"> </span></em></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;"><em>(Bringing it all together – after a month the group would reconvene with their findings and continue with a deeper data analysis)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#3366ff;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;"> Rationale</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;">The portfolio brought our research project to natural conclusion and focus on issues surrounding politics, multiculturalism and the environment, issues which pervade national boarders and impact nations across the globe. Thus, as different group members can offer <span style="font-family:Calibri;">multiple cultural perspectives due to a mix of British and Chinese researchers</span>, we decided to use these invaluable cultural insights and conduct a multi-sited research project, exploring fake news in both Britain and China. A multi-sited study is arguably imperative, as fake news is likely to differ immensely in content, focus and style across different spaces and cultures, and should therefore be explored on an international level. Similarly, in an age of mass-communication and globalization where news information can be transported around the world in a second, it is essential that the methods we employ have the ability to follow these flows in a similar fashion.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;">It should be noted that the researchers conducting the ethnographic studies </span></span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;">will also be citizens of these countries so as to ensure that as researchers we do not misrepresent nations overseas. Further still, beyond avoiding theoretical implications, ensuring that the ethnographic research is only conducted by those familiar with the space, logistical issues are also avoided, such as language barriers, visas and accommodation etc. Hence, the presence of four researchers is incredibly useful, as it allows multiple methods to be explored simultaneously (reducing the amount of time and funding required) as each member can work on a different project and bring a different insight and perspective to the collective research project. Bhambra reinforces the salience of research which takes into account other cultures and histories, often erased from the social sciences as a consequence of ‘Eurocentrism’ (2009). </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;">Furthermore, the two researchers not conducting the ethnographical studies would conduct the textual analysis, as this would ensure that the researcher is not to heavily involved in the media institution itself as a result of building a rapport with its producers over time, and will be able to take a step back from the media text more easily. The textual analysis will explore the British and Chinese institutions media output over a two week timeframe, producing research to accompany the participant observation within the institutions themselves. However, due to issues surrounding access and gatekeepers, there is ambiguity surrounding which specific news outlets we would be investigating. Yet such an insight would provide a thorough and in depth snapshot of the given institutions and may uncover how they avoid fake news, or reinforce it. Similarly, by coupling media and empirical research methods together, the data will be able to discover beyond what is produced and explore why and how news is produced in a particular way.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although in theory a rigorously defined research programme is desirable and a nice idea, when it comes to under taking research in practice, especially in the social sciences, it is not always possible and indeed it may inhibit the full exploration of a given topic. Regarding our own research on the subject of fake news, a topic none of us had researched previously, we were unsure what information and materials would be available to us. We have therefore put together a<span class="text_exposed_show"> portfolio that includes a range of different topics and stories that come under the general heading of fake news. Thus the next step in our research will be to connect these seemingly disparate topics, forming a montage that will provide a useful means of disciplining and understanding the data. Indeed following Crang&#8217;s thinking and analysis are not purely theoretical models in our heads, but they involve the manipulation of a range of material confined to specific locations. This means we need to start with the organisation of our materials. </span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">This physical organisation of the various fake news articles aids the development of thinking and interpreting the data. For this task the online blog is particularly useful as it allows for the literal manipulation and mapping out of the various materials. Additionally, the blog provides an interactive space in which the members of the group are able to think with one another with the use of this interactive interface, our task is to make the data intelligible in the form of a montage. In film montages are ways of editing and telling stories outside of temporal constraints, in this way the fake news on the blog can be read as individual montages. But additionally we are able to create a larger montage out of the self-contained montages that are the individual instances of fake news. In this way we create a montage out of montages. </span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>In light of the messy process of gathering information and the method of the montage, the narrative that has unintentionally emerged from our portfolio is one that centres around politics, often centred around but not limited to the fake news stories surrounding Donald trump and climate change. In addition, our portfolio contains stories that link both president Trump and climate change, not least as he famously remarked climate change is a hoax created by the Liberal Democrat politicians and China.<br />
Perhaps our montage has revealed these topics as the prevailing and connecting themes  as a result of the American presidential campaign that brought fake news into the public eye. Indeed the link provided bellow suggests that fake news or ‘alternative facts’ are embraced by the Trump administration.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSrEEDQgFc8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#0066cc;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSrEEDQgFc8</span></a></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="id_58cc21fc61c744272980128" class="text_exposed_root text_exposed">
<p>However, there is a need for deeper analysis and new ways of approaching the topic of fake news<i>,</i> I have consequently considered how we could approach the subject of fake news using Baudrillard and the article on Spinoza in the discussion below.</p>
<p>Following Baudrillard, fake news could be read as a symptom generated by the hyper real&#8230; Hyper-reality being a world in which the lack of the real,<span class="text_exposed_show"> is covered up by a paranoiac over production of simulacra (signs that do not seek to represent the real) (1981). Baudrillard raises an interesting point regarding Disney land. Disney land functions in so far as it pretends to be outside of normality, a fictional world (1981). In this way it covers up the fact the wider society is just as hyper real. Perhaps this logic could be applied to fake news, as hyper reality dissolves oppositions such as true and false. Perhaps fake news can be read as sustaining the illusion that the opposition between true and false is a meaningful distinction in a world saturated by simulacra. Additionally, following the article that reads fake news through Spinoza, this reading may provide a critique of fake news that does not fall into the largely meaningless debate concerning the truth. Events such as climate change, the election of Donald trump (a proven liar) and the proliferation of fake news suggests we cant appose untruth with truth alone. But again following the Spinoza text, the affects fake news produces must be and can be challenged by alternative affects. Also I suggest caution with the Baudrilardian reading in so far as we can not give up on the distinction between true and false entirely, as fake news is predicated on this opposition. </span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">We can take two directions, either give up on the distinction between real and fake news, or consider Baudrillards theory as a partial one, a useful tool for challenging oppositions, but by no means a totalising theory. In other words reading Baudrillards theory of simulacra as documenting a process whereby more and more of reality becomes hyper real, which results in an increased disorientation regarding distinctions such as true and false, real and fake. But by no means totally forecloses the possibility of these categories having some validity. In this way perhaps the truth needs to be supplemented with affect, as time and time again it would appear affect is far more powerful than the notion of the truth in a post truth or hyper real society. Following the reflections on week 2 I would like to suggest fake news demands engaging with more philosophical questions in media and cultural studies in contrast to Couldrys claim, that media and cultural studies does not need to address these things(2000).</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week ethnography is the main method, which means writing, drawing and telling peoples stories, phenomena and networks. This method normally focuses on one case or place, which is called a “field site”. A field site is a place where an ethnographer does “fieldwork”(Mackenzie: 2017) and as our project focuses on fake news, it makes sense that ethnography could be a useful method, as we can observe how audiences make sense of fake news in particular media spaces and how fake news affects them in their social and cultural context.</p>
<p>Ethnography maintains that it is important to consider digital platforms in addition to physical field sites in modern society. Particularly as most people now access news stories and information in cyberspace, and in many cases on social media platforms such as <strong>Facebook, </strong>whom withhold the capacity to circulate fake news. Thus for ethnographers, it is a crucial field site for exploring fake news, especially as social media facilitates further sharing and interaction amongst audience members. However, <strong>online/offline worlds need to coexistent in the group research. </strong>Studying objects, like people or the news, can help reveal differences or draw comparisons between different forms of places. Hence, multisided ethnography would be an appropriate method for researching spaces such as those noted during initial group discussions which included; Facebook, newsrooms and Buddhist temples.</p>
<p><strong>Place: Fake news groups on Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>People I want to meet and talk and spend time with:</strong> Fake news group members</p>
<p>By locating fake news posts on Facebook, we could find out how people make sense of these forms of news by engaging with the group and participating in the sharing and discussion of fake news. Interviewing readers would also be a key component in this research method and later comparisons could be drawn by looking at the responses of individuals from different generations—young people and middle-aged people, for instance—and educational backgrounds (professors and domestic workers). In interviews, questions could include,</p>
<p>l  What fake news these people are interested in?</p>
<p>l  Why are these people interested in fake news?</p>
<p>l  How they normally read the fake news?</p>
<p>Also, by setting up a group research Facebook page within the field site itself, we are able to “access into subcultures, niche social movement, and marginal/vulnerable groups” with greater ease than ever before (Murthy, 2010,p.25). Especially as gatekeepers are minimal and a wide variety of the population use Facebook, producing a rich sample site.</p>

<p><strong>Place: Paul Horner Facebook page</strong></p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.facebook.com/IAmPaulHornerBowDown/" rel="nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/IAmPaulHornerBowDown/</a>)</p>
<p><strong>People I want to meet and spend time with: Pawl Horner, fake news writer</strong></p>
<p>While conducting research focused on fake news, Pawl Horner cannot be ignored. He arguably withheld an enormous impact on the 2016 U.S. presidential election as he wrote and circulated an abundance of fake news stories, including “Donald Trump Requiring All To wear Badges” and “President Obama Signs Executive Order Banning The National Anthem” (Inside edition, 2016). Questionable actions which in fact made him a lot of money,” about $10,000 a month” (Inside edition: 2016).</p>
<p><em>“When a lot of people read those stories he gets a certain amount of money for each person that clicks through and that adds up to a lot of money” </em>(Inside edition: 2016).</p>
<p>Hence interviewing Horner would provide an indispensable insight into the motivations of fake news producers and uncover whether the financial incentives are the driving force, or if as Horner insists, fake news seeks to provide satire in an increasingly media saturated world. In this interview, I would focus on questions:</p>
<p>l  Does writing fake news become a new job now?</p>
<p>l  From Horner’s point of view, why are there so many people like reading the fake news?</p>

<p><strong>P</strong></p>
<p><strong>lace : The Guardian Newsroom</strong></p>
<p><strong>People I want to meet and spend time with: Journalists of The Guardian</strong></p>
<p>In terms of physical places, firstly, there are newsrooms, the Guardian, for example. The phenomenon of fake news is incredibly popular, to the extent that the concept of “post-truth” is now being used to describe the current political climate (Wang: 2016). However, under these circumstances the reaction of traditional media such as newspapers is important. Hence, during an ethnographical study I would observe how reputable journalists and news editors examine their own daily news, before delivering it to the public as this would provide a valuable insight into the dynamics of news production and how fake news is avoided in large institutions. Whilst also listening and talking to this group about how they feel about fake news in their own everyday lives, could also provide an interesting insight. Furthermore, this insight could uncover ways in which readers could detect what is fake news themselves.</p>
<p>It should be noted that during one-to-one interviews, it is imperative that sound recording devices are used to collect data, as it allows for a more natural exchange of conversation and ensures interviewees are not misquoted, perhaps demonstrating a method journalists might use to minimise the potential of their own stories to produce fake news.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Place: A Buddhist temple </strong></p>
<p><strong>People I want to meet and spend time with: Monks in the temple whom may not encounter or be aware of the fake news.</strong></p>
<p>Finally, exploring a Buddhist temple could be an extreme example, as it is often assumed that monks living in temples will not be allowed to use social media and thus will not encounter fake news. Yet, Pecorella (2016) notes in the article, <em>Buddhism and Social Media: The 21st Century Monk</em>, Buddhist monks could use the Internet and get information on Facebook. Although research opportunities may be limited as it is not easy to access to a temple, there are however Buddhist monk groups on Facebook (See figure 3), which means interviewing them on internet-based platforms could be possible. Nevertheless, it would be better to go to a real temple if possible, so as to explore the differences in how monks react to fake news in different places(online/offline) as a group often assumed to not be immersed in media. The main questions I would ask include:</p>
<p>l  Could they know how to distinguish what news is true or fake?</p>
<p>l  Does fake news affect them? If yes, how? If not, why?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we had a very interesting discussion surrounding the use of discourse analysis to explore Fake News. Discourse may be understood in the Foucauldian sense as a &#8216;structuring structure&#8217; which produces systems of meaning, which shape our knowledge and consequent practices. Foucault&#8217;s (2002) work on discourse and its widespread power influenced the work of many theorists, including Edward Said a theorist also discussed briefly in week 3 (1991). Said&#8217;s concept of Orientalism (1991) provides an exquisite exemplar of how discourse analysis may be applied to uncover understandings which are at first hidden or taken for granted. Adapting Foucauldian discourse, Said applied the method of analysis to a vast array of literature of the &#8216;Orient&#8217;, predominantly produced by writers from the West constituting a &#8216;hermetic history&#8217; (1991: 23). Said found that despite spatial and temporal differences, the literature consistently constructed the East as a dangerous and backward place, with a violent and uneducated population (1991). Further still, those residing in the East unable to represent themselves in these texts were constructed as an absolute &#8216;other&#8217; too Westerners, through dichotomous understandings such as tradition/cosmopolitanism and religion/secularism. Such understandings work to reassert notions of the Western identity which may be recognised as a discursive formation, often unseen and difficult to define when not in relation to others. That said, mutually supporting constructions constituting an Orientalist discourse may be witnessed across all media platforms today, demonstrating the salience of  self-representation.</p>
<p>As demonstrated by Said and others, discourse analysis offers unlimited exploration which is well suited to the study of fake news, as just as discourses are omnipresent, operating across all media platforms, spaces and time, so is the phenomenon of fake news. If we consider an analysis of fake news in 2017 without an application of discourse analysis, we risk missing the immense history of propaganda, and the multiple levels of misinformation within the media throughout history. Thus, during group discussions we concluded that this method would be highly applicable and useful in this context, as fake news is evident across all media platforms and institutions, and therefore requires a method of analysis able to explore this wide variety of sources, uncovering similarities and differences. Furthermore, through a Foucauldian discourse analysis we may understand the discurs<span class="text_exposed_show">ive construction of the truth as imperative for the functioning of democracy, which consequently shapes our understanding of fake news as a potentially destructive force. Without the given methodology this common sense understanding would be particularly difficult to uncover and explain due to our own situating within the context, rendering the discursive formation invisible to us.</span></p>

<p>Initial group discussions of fake news considered the concepts of simulacra, the hyper-real and the notion of the spectacle (Baudrillard: 1988/ 1983) (Debord: 1994), in relation to post truth politics and the Trump campaign. Suggesting that the obesity of information may reduce the level of reflexivity and consequently allows Fake News stories to circulate more freely online. Baudrillard refers to this implosion of information as an &#8216;ecstasy&#8217; of communication, through which less real communication actually occurs (Baudrillard: 1988). This paradox is highly applicable to the issue of fake news, as it is not in the absence of &#8216;real&#8217; news that fake news proliferates, but in the overabundance of news itself. Leading the masses to become apathetic and the political arena &#8216;vacuous&#8217; and &#8217;empty&#8217;, arguably demonstrated by the American publics suicidal election of Trump, a man with virtually no experience but the ability to produce a marvellous spectacle  (Baudrillard 1988: 110). A similar understanding could be applied to Britains decision to leave the European Union and seek independence.</p>
<p>For example, if we apply a discourse analysis to the image below we are able to uncover various hidden meanings previously concealed.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="138" data-permalink="https://fakenewsproject.wordpress.com/2017/03/19/relevant-imagery/nigel-farage-brexit-getty/" data-orig-file="https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/nigel-farage-brexit-getty.jpg?w=1000" data-orig-size="2500,1875" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="nigel-farage-brexit-getty" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/nigel-farage-brexit-getty.jpg?w=1000?w=300" data-large-file="https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/nigel-farage-brexit-getty.jpg?w=1000?w=1000" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-138" src="https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/nigel-farage-brexit-getty.jpg?w=1000" alt="nigel-farage-brexit-getty" srcset="https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/nigel-farage-brexit-getty.jpg?w=1000 1000w, https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/nigel-farage-brexit-getty.jpg?w=2000 2000w, https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/nigel-farage-brexit-getty.jpg?w=150 150w, https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/nigel-farage-brexit-getty.jpg?w=300 300w, https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/nigel-farage-brexit-getty.jpg?w=768 768w, https://fakenewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/nigel-farage-brexit-getty.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"   /></p>
</div>
<p>At face value the image merely denotes a white male assumed to be a politician, fighting emotively for a country he cares deeply about. Farage, open mouthed in mid-speech clings to a board which reads, &#8216;We want our country back Vote to Leave&#8217; standing in front of a large screen which reiterates the same statement in capitalised form &#8216;WE WANT OUR COUNTRY BACK&#8217; (mirroring visually Baudrillard&#8217;s obesity of information) , implying that the country from which he belongs has been taken over by someone else, and yet this is far from the case. Without an application of discourse analysis there is much that an audience may take for granted here, such as the history of colonial conquest inscribed upon Farage&#8217;s treasured nation. Furthermore, the emotionally charged text and image reproduce an anti-immigration discourse, characterised by the discursive entity of national identity and nationhood, which creates imaginary boarders where there are physically none.</p>
<p>Anti-immigration discourses such as that connoted in this image rely on the erasure of the historical slave labour and colonialism, which aided the industrial revolution producing the modern nation recognised today, from the collective consciousness of the British public (Bhambra: 2009). Hence, an ironic undertone may be recognised within this image, as the majority of nations overseas annually celebrate independence from Britain, and yet Mr. Farage purports that it British nationals themselves who must seek independence, as if joining in a peaceful union with our neighbouring countries (Europe) following the death of millions during WW&#8217;s constitutes a loss of our country&#8217;s nationhood, akin to the brutal and bloody imperialism we historically inflicted on over a quarter of the worlds population (Bhambra: 2009). Further still, Farage&#8217;s position of privilege as a white, heterosexual, middle class male endows him with power to make such claims. However, it should be noted that such a reading requires the audience to possess a knowledge of imperialism and inequality, and as such it is unlikely that all audience members would recognise the discursive entities at play here. Regardless, discourse analysis is essential for &#8216;showing seeing&#8217; as it withholds the power to structure how things are thought and our consequent actions (Mitchell: 2002).</p>
<p>However, the question still remains, does the image above constitute fake news as a result of its ignorance, or does its visual construction of anti-immigration discourse merely mirror the very real discursive entity of nationhood shaping Britain today? Nations may be socially constructed, but does that make them &#8216;unreal&#8217; and fake in the everyday lives of the wider public?</p>

<p><a href="http://cnn.com.de/news/obama-signs-executive-order-banning-pledge-allegiance-schools-nationwide/" rel="nofollow">http://cnn.com.de/news/obama-signs-executive-order-banning-pledge-allegiance-schools-nationwide/</a><br />
In the image, President Obama is signing the Executive Order 13738, which revokes the federal government&#8217;s official recognition to the Pledge of Allegiance. Ten politicians are watching his behaviour, smiling. Facebook spread this fake news in 2016. Diversity is connoted through the presence of different genders and races in the image, which may convince a wider audience of the news&#8217;s authenticity. Furthermore, the colour of this image is predominantly dark, almost black, which is a basic colour of formal suits. Only the female politician is denoted wearing a light blue coloured suit, highlighting her presence. The background is indigo blue, which is a typical symbolic colour of a government press conference. The light of this image is neutral and instils a sense of documentary photography. The structure of the image resembles an inverted triangle, drawing the audiences gaze inward to Obama, whose beaming grin invokes confidence from the audience, as we are invited to share his positive emotions. The politicians standing around and watching President Obama are the top sides of the inverted triangle whilst their eye lines construct the other sides of the triangle. The whole image is filled with figures and only one fourth is background. This image is a fairly close up shot and the audience is positioned front-left to these politicians and provided a horizontal, eyelevel shot, connotations of which create a sense of openness and shared insight, as the audience gaze mirrors that of the image.<br />

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-hackers-penetrated-us-electricity-grid-through-a-utility-in-vermont/2016/12/30/8fc90cc4-ceec-11e6-b8a2-8c2a61b0436f_story.html?utm_term=.35bd26b9e754" rel="nofollow">https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-hackers-penetrated-us-electricity-grid-through-a-utility-in-vermont/2016/12/30/8fc90cc4-ceec-11e6-b8a2-8c2a61b0436f_story.html?utm_term=.35bd26b9e754</a><br />
Another example of fake news is the story outlined above where a &#8220;Russian operation hacked a Vermont utility, showing risk to U.S. electrical grid security, officials say&#8221; by the Washington Post. The image accompanying this headline denotes Obama and Putin staring into each others eyes while leaning inwards, connotations of which are a relationship which is cold and hostile. Also denoted in the background are their countries&#8217; national flags, whose prominence is reinforced by the shared colour scheme of red, white and blue throughout the image, connoting the significance of national identity and difference. The dark, formal Presidents&#8217; suits are juxtaposed with their lack of formal ties and undone top shirt buttons, suggesting  a slightly informal setting despite the implied public backdrop, connotations of which suggest that this extends beyond their leadership roles and that the pair do not share any sense of kinship outside of their work related roles. Furthermore, these connotations support the fake news headline presented within The Washington Post column itself.  The two Presidents are well lit, ensuring that they are the focus within the image, whilst Obama&#8217;s placement on the left and Putin on the right cleverly depicts their political standpoints visually, as Putin represents right-wing politics on the right, and Obama left-wing politics on the left. Readers can feel the furious spark between these two leaders, as their clasped hands rest firmly upon the arms of their chairs behind their controlled gaze, which appears to be forcibly level so as not to allow either party a more powerful downward gaze over the other. The audience is situated almost between this conflictive image as the leaders are leaning towards each other.</p>
<p><strong>Visual analysis</strong><br />
As demonstrated above, visual analysis concentrates on the context in which an image is seen. As Marita Sturken and Lisa Cartwright (2001) argued, visual objects carry little inherent meaning; &#8216;one of the central tenets of this book is that meaning does not reside within images, but are produced at the moment that they are consumed by and circulated among viewers&#8217;. (Sturken and Cartwright 2001:7) Therefore, in order to analyse these two visual entities, we should attempt to co-opt the meaning it carries itself, its viewers&#8217; interpretations and the context where it is seen.<br />
We have already explored the ostensible meaning that is carried above through compositional analysis. It is imperative that we analyse the practices of visual objects, as argued by Rose who states that &#8216;practices are always embedded in specific places'(Gillian 2012: 549). The first image was spread widely on Facebook in 2016 so its seen places are fluid due to the conventions of e-media platforms, yet these places are specific to individuals and will thus vary between different individuals. As the second image was circulated in a newspaper, it is arguably not as convenient as Facebook. Viewers may read the text in public spaces such as the tube or from the privacy of their own home. Usually when audiences engage with a newspaper, they need to stay in a place where there is artificial light which requires electricity. Therefore, the latter form of fake news may have more limited forms and therefore spaces for engagement. However, &#8216;the space performed by practices, including visual practices, is not necessarily a simple question of location. It might also entail all sorts of other geographies, of various geometries and modalities.&#8217; (Gillian 2012: 549). Thus in the future study, we should not bypass the potential exploration of further geographical sites which could lead us to more profound meanings of the visual objects.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div></div>
<div>As the purpose of Media Studies so often involves the dissemination of media texts, in order to reveal hidden semiotic meanings, the discipline will be a key player in challenging the growing myriad of &#8216;fake news&#8217; across different media platforms. Especially as it is difficult to know what the term fake news encompasses in an age saturated by media, increasingly produced by the public themselves. Highlighting the necessity of an analysis informed by Media Studies methodologies, despite the current governments somewhat ironic attempts to quell the discipline at GCSE and A level.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The growing presence of fake news threatens to undermine the integrity of news media outlets, as the lines between authenticity and integrity become blurred. Even more so, as traditional media forms such as print and broadcast allow their political position to pollute the information they provide. In this sense, fake news arguably operates on a multi-level basis, with large corporate news outlets at the top, insidiously providing one sided and often bias information, whilst clickbait articles operate as the most basic form of fake news, earning profits from shock tactic headlines, which draw in hits and consequent advertising revenue. Consequently it could be argued that fake news is not a new phenomenon, as propaganda has been in circulation throughout history, even as far back as the Tudors according to Rodgers (2017).</div>
<div></div>
<div>Nevertheless, recent examples of fake news such as US Fox News’ assertion that Birmingham is a Muslim only area demonstrate the scale the problem (See link below). Yet, unlike large corporate news outlets such as Fox, online sources are much more difficult to hold accountable. Particularly as those responsible are often unknown, clouding the power dynamics at play.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In this sense, and due to its newest online forms, Fake News is becoming increasingly difficult to define and differentiate from mainstream news. Which is why Media Studies must offer a focus on the issue, more so than ever during this time of great uncertainty. As expert opinion is increasingly denounced by the powerful, from Donald Trump to Nigel Farage, post-truth politics and anti-academic sentiment appears to be cemented into the rhetoric of the future. Which in the unstable era of climate change and nuclear deterrents is deeply concerning.</div>

		<description><![CDATA[This week we explored the implications of Couldrys account of culture, power and experience. The answer to Couldrys question for media and cultural studies, “What do we hope to study”? for us is fake news ( 2000 p12). Regarding this subject and following Couldry, a broad methodological question to be asked is how best does one approach the subject? And what problems may this subject give rise to for the discipline of media and cultural studies (2000).<img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fakenewsproject.wordpress.com&#038;blog=125057479&#038;post=5&#038;subd=fakenewsproject&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="text_exposed_show">This week we explored the implications of Couldrys account of culture, power and experience. The answer to Couldrys question for media and cultural studies, “What do we hope to study”? for us is fake news, but how does one approach this subject?</span><span class="text_exposed_show"> And what problems may this subject give rise to for the discipline of media and cultural studies?(2000: 21).</span></p>
<p>For Couldry the study of culture addresses its relation to power, arguing that in cultural studies, only the areas of research that have the methodological tools able to systematically explicate the relations between culture and power come under his definition of the discipline (2000). He also emphasizes the democratic nature of media and cultural studies, in so far as anyone can contribute to culture. An aspect of his work that is certainly relevant here, as anyone is able to create fake news, circulate it online and receive capital from people clicking on it.</p>
<p>The first instance of fake news we discussed occurred in china where news outlets claimed salt in china could become contaminated as a result of a nuclear leek in Japan, which resulted in lots of people rushing to the shops and buying copious amounts of salt leading, which in turn lead to salt being sold out in most places. Perhaps this story was so effective because of the history of food contamination making headline news in the past.<br />
Further still, we felt that this news story could have been a very powerful marketing strategy produced by the salt industry, whom purposely intended to manipulate people into panic buying salt, in the wake of reductions in consumption due to health concerns. Here Couldrys concern with power and culture/media is interesting and useful for understanding this instance of fake news. Although this news story was fake, due to the history of moral panics surrounding bad food, the grounds for this fake news story to shape reality where already in place. In this way fake news is bound up with power, the power to effect the real.</p>
<p>Here Baudrillards work on simulacra and simulation is interesting for exploring the relationship between fake news and reality (1981). According to Baudrillard simulacra are signs that do not represent the real, instead they operate independently from reality, in this way he reverses how the relationship between signified and the signifier is traditionally thought of (1981). Indeed he argues these signs precede the real, shaping the real in its image (1981). The fake news in China that lead to the panic purchasing of salt is a prime example of how something which does not represent reality comes to effect reality. (for this article see “fearing radiation, Chinese rush to buy salt?” in the references list below)</p>
<p>The Second story we discussed involved an individual posing as a news reporter, getting angry and ranting about the affairs of the day. The news was true, but very biased towards a left wing ideology. The question it raised was can something be considered fake news if it is framing the truth, ergo communicating the truth but in a false way, a fake way. Here Peter Sloterdjk&#8217;s notion of enlightened false consciousness is interesting. This term refers to an ideological operation that presents the truth in a false way (1987). This example, it could be argued calls into question Couldrys contention media and cultural studies does not have to concern itself with fundamental philosophical questions (2000). The example of the fake news report telling the “truth” suggests the study of fake news requires the use of fundamentally philosophical questions not only about truth, but also as mentioned earlier with reference to Baudrillard, the nature of reality (1981)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Working With Texts: from semiotic to textual environments</p>
<p>As my colleague Olie indicated in last weeks post, Couldry states that anyone can contribute to culture by going &#8220;inside culture&#8221;(Couldry 2000: 4). However, for researchers of media and cultural studies, the question is what methods we can apply in order to analyse media and culture, as part of a &#8216;dense network of interconnections between texts'(Couldry 2000: 69). In this sense, we shall employ textual analysis and explore both semiotics and the textual environment, which will not only consider the text independently but also the textual environment, consisting of various patterns of flows; flows of meanings, texts and potential readers (Couldry 2000: 87). Couldry recognises textual analysis as a method which enables the researcher to unpack complex &#8220;interrelated meanings which its readers tend to interpret as a discrete, unified whole&#8221;(Couldry 2000: 70-71). In short, &#8216;texts&#8217; can be objects or items, such as basketball shirts, cereal packages, films or magazines, sharing different forms of textuality or tactics (Couldry: 2000). Thus, textual analysis represents a sociologically informed approach to texts, which considers texts as social objects commanding different levels of engagement. As such by &#8216;de-centering&#8217; a text we may understand it as a mere component of an entire textual environment navigated by audiences in a variety of ways (Couldry 2000: 69). In order to exemplify this method we shall deconstruct the image below through an application of textual analysis coupled with a semiotic analysis, due to the images systematic features which render semiology a useful tool in this instance (Couldry: 2000).</p>

<p>The image above, which is a segment from a propaganda leaflet which was distributed across Britain during Brexit and in most cases put through peoples letter boxes, proposed that it was offering impartial and factual advice. As one of the researchers received the leaflet itself we were lucky enough to be able to have access to these details of its original textual environment and intended audience and purpose. The information presented suggests that large portions of the Albanian, Macedonian, Montenegro and Syrian populations, will migrate to Britain when these countries join the European Union and if Britain voted to remain.</p>
<p>As semiology is most suited to texts which have undergone cultural production including systematic features, the method is highly applicable here. However, it should be noted that semiology is not a &#8216;general science&#8217; and should not be applied to cultural signs in general as Couldry critiques (2000: 75). In its most basic form, Semiology refers to &#8216;the study of signs&#8217; which are &#8220;are units of meaning, and semiologists argue that anything that has meaning&#8221; may be analysed using this method, as these meanings arise out of relations between key signs in texts (Rose 2007: 75/79). Thus, the text above consists of a system of signs which connote and reproduce specific meanings. The immediate sign one notices in the text is the map alongside recognisable icons of human figures, with the male icons being more predominant in number and positioning. Connotations of which imply that the immigrants will be more likely to be male than female, whilst the choice of the colour red connotes a semiotic reading of blood and danger. Further still, this semiotic construction of dangerous male immigrants is juxtaposed with the navy blue image of Britain, signifying a sense of infiltration and difference. Similarly the main colours in this pro-nationalist image deliberately mirror the colours in the national flag, connoting a sense of collectivism, but only among the nation itself. These simple construction techniques ensure that before the audience has even engaged with the writing, a hostile and nationalist rhetoric has been produced, demonstrating the salience of semiotic analysis for uncovering that which may ordinarily be taken for granted.</p>
<p>The writing &#8220;If we vote to stay in the EU&#8221;, &#8220;the EU will continue to grow&#8221; and population figures (which when checked further are for the most part rounded up), are also printed in bright red, reinforcing the intention to scare people and prompt people to &#8216;vote leave&#8217;, regardless of the non-existent evidence for these predictions, mirroring key components of fake news. Thus, the text is deeply problematic and reinforces an Orientalist perspective, outlined by Said as the lens through which the West views the East as barbaric, backwards and characterised by Islamic fundamentalism and violence (1991). A perspective that is reaffirmed in the text at the bottom of the image which warns readers that, &#8220;The next countries the EU wants to let in include Turkey, which has a population of over 76 million, and borders with Syria and Iraq&#8221;, which selectively highlights these Muslim majority countries in an attempt to conjure connotations of fear, difference and &#8216;other&#8217; these groups. Although it should be noted that the types of Islam these countries ascribe to is very different and there is equal amounts of religious diversity within each nation, despite the implied homogeneity the text implies. Thus the texts semiotic reading reproduces troubling hegemonic discourses of Orientalism through mere choices of colour, imagery and text, a perspective which arguably lead to the successful victory of the Leave campaign, as Britain voted to leave the European Union in 2016.</p>
<p>For Couldry, textual analysis takes into account &#8220;the different ways in which something can function as a text for its reader&#8221; which is essential here, as the discussion above is highly unlikely to mirror the perspective of the wider audience at the time; demonstrated by the occurrence of Brexit itself (Couldry 2000: 71). Although propaganda leaflets possess a set of conventions and a predominant form, there are myriads of different forms in this textuality as &#8220;[i]t is not a stand-alone reference point&#8221;(Clancy: 2014). Not only does the producers decisions to arrange the information in different spaces or styles shape the readers understanding, the readers own pre-conceived ideas will also inform their reading of the text. In this sense, if we want to be clear about textuality, we need to ask firstly how does a text get taken up in different social and cultural formations (Couldry: 2000).</p>
<p>Textual analysis of the textual environment is essential as it makes us focus on both texts and readers in a way that may be limited in semiology alone. In other words, &#8220;text and readers are co-produced&#8221;, and we must explore this relationship (Mackenzie: 2017). Referring back to the Brexit leaflet we can most certainly understand how audiences may interpret this fake news differently. For example, highly educated individuals such university students (and graduates), are exposed to a wide variety of cultures within this space and are likely to be privileged enough to travel overseas as a result of greater financial means. As a consequence, many students (particularly those attuned to dissecting media texts such as media and cultural studies and sociology students) are more likely to recognise the leaflet as problematic propaganda and constituting bias and in-factual fake news. By contrast, individuals of a working class background granted less opportunities and financial means are predisposed to this rhetoric as it works to displace the blame onto immigrants as opposed to the failing, crisis prone economic system and as such are likely to be the intended audience for this text (Owen: 2011). Further still, as higher education is more widely accessed by the middle class population, working class groups have limited access to peer reviewed academic journals and books by comparison. In other words, readers will make their own assumptions about the text because of their own experiences (Clancy: 2014). Similarly, political positions will shape individuals readings, as the audience seeks to reaffirm their pre-existing political standpoint, either using these figures as ammunition for the extreme right-wing vote leave campaign, or dismissing and dismantling the claims from a left-wing perspective. Recognised by Festinger as cognitive dissonance, this social phenomena is a key concept in understanding how audiences operate in the textual environment.<br />
Moreover, readers from different cultures and countries will interpret this fake news in different ways. I suggest that we should be &#8216;inside culture&#8217; when we discuss texts in the textual environment, which helps us open our minds about our research. Thus, as the leaflet is about Brexit, British people would engage with it, and by contrast, the Chinese population probably would not have a strong feeling about it.</p>
<p>The above analysis of the textual environment differs from the semiotic analysis of the text, as the &#8220;text and readers are conceived as being co-produced within a reading of information&#8221;(Couldry 2000: 82). Within semiotic analysis, we could just focus on key signs and relations between them, however it is important to consider the intended audience in the analysis of the textual environment, such as identity aspects including intersections of class, gender, ethnicity and so on. As we have demonstrated, texts are complex and flowing and as such researchers must employ a methodology which has the ability to consider and follow these flows.</p>
