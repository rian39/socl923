# Session ideas

## 1. course outline; intros;

notions of culture and media; look at wikipedia; apply to  ikea; look at their objects; blogs

## 2. Working with texts 

 wikipedia -- how to read it; zotero + google scholar + Web of knowledge
 
### Objectives: 

 1. Understand what it means to do a close reading of an academic texts;
 2. Describe the differences between cultural studies and cultural sociology/anthropology or communication studies in terms of values;
 3. Outline how cultural studies  approaches questions of power;
 4. Explain the role of experience in cultural studies;
 5. Exemplify group research topic through a few key textual, visual or audiovisual materials;
 6. Sketch how  questions of values, power and experience apply to research topic;
 7. Preliminary practice in the basic technique of the interview

### Activities

- learn the couldry quote off by heart
- in groups, work out the meanings of empirical/materialist; power-laden; self-reflexive; 

### Quotes to use
 	> 'cultural studies is an expanding space for sustained, rigorous and self-reflexive  empirical research into the massive, power-laden complexity of contemporary culture'  (Couldry, 2000, 1)

## 3.  Working with texts II

- questions from Couldry ch4 - pp87-88 - develop a map of yr textual world -- consuming what, connecting what, what can I read carefully or put down; 
- using zotero for academic references and other references!
- blogs, twitter, facebook -- how would you read them ...  what is the textual unit of experience - the cereal packet example'
- trace a vast space of inter-connected texts

### Objectives: 

1. Practice performing close semiological readings of texts in terms of common cultural codes
2. Describe some of the limitations of reading texts or  'the text' in isolation
3. Describe the problem of 'too many texts' in terms in 'inter-textuality';
3. Explain the notions of textuality and  textual environment and how they differ from 'text'
4. Describe some ways of researching  textual environments  in terms of flow of meanings, texts and readers


### Quotes to use

>  Instead of the discrete text-reader relationship, we are looking at a textual environment comprising complex patterns of flows: flows of meanings, texts and potential readers (Couldry, 2000, 87)

> In the vast textual fields we inhabit, it is order rather than uncertainty that we need to explain 87

### Key points
1. The text itself is too limited -- traditional model just stabilizes meanings. Ask: what is a text as a social object?
2. Too many texts -- media + inter-textuality; ask about text as complex of interrelated meanings; textuality as how text will be handled and investment in specific forms; tactics as how people select and filter
3. The importance of structuralism and semiology: good when meanings are standardised
4. Textual analysis after the deluge: expert ok if reflexive; look at how it is read actually (but don't expand the text to the mall); or the mediasphere with no readers);
5. What to do: textual environment that includes actual readers _ flow of meanings, texts and readers; processes of textualization, co-production of text and reader; textual events;
6. In textual environment, study stabilising, circulation and tactics e.g. in advertising; including ignoring
7. In patterns of belief: wider patterns of belief and how they connect with media (cynicism, enthusiasm, mistrust)
8. In textual events, study how that text came to be the one? How is that text actually read?

## Activity

Take the example you have chosen and locate them in a textual environment. What flows of meaning, what flows of text and what flow of readers help surround these example texts? 

## 4. Working with images


### Objectives: 

By the end of this session, you should be able to:

1. Describe the difference between visual culture and visual studies;
2. List some of the key 'myths' and 'fallacies' of visual culture, including the 'naturalistic fallacy';
3. Explain what is meant by the term 'pictorial turn';
4. Outline how visual culture can be treated  as a 'go-between' in social transactions (Mitchell);
5. Describe and analyse an image using the 'showing seeing' method;
6. Understand the difference between the social construction of vision and visual construction of the social;

### Quotes to use

> I propose what I hope is a more nuanced and balanced approach located in the equivocation between the visual image as instrument and agency, the image as a tool for manipulation, on the one hand, and as an apparently autonomous source of its own purposes and meanings on the other. This approach would treat visual culture and visual images as go-betweens in social transactions, as a repertoire of screen images or templates that structure our encounters with other human beings (Mitchell, 2002, 176)

## 5. Working with audiovisuals

### Objectives: 

Describe the 'implicit methodology' of critique found in most visual culture studies, and list some of its limitations;
List and exemplify some of the different  ways in which meaning is made;
Define various aspects of the concept of 'practice' and what they imply in relation to visual culture;
Explain and demonstrate what reflexivity means in relation to visual culture;
Outline some ways in which critique might be done differently.

### Key quotes

> A practice, then, is a fairly consistent way of doing something, deploying certain objects, knowledges, bodily gestures and emotions (Rose, 2012, 549)

> Different ways of seeing are bound up into different, more-or-less conscious, more-or-less elaborate, more-or-less consistent practices. Visualities are one practice among many, and in their routinization and place-specificity they make certain sorts of things visible in particular ways (Rose, 2012, 549)

Reflexion ... means thinking of interpretative practices as both 'method and object of questioning'  ... Aspects of methodology are paused over, examined, rehearsed and revised, as the research process proceeds and things are learnt from the research objects (Rose, 2012, 551)

### Activities

- do an 'implicit methodology' reading of an image
- redo showing-seeing exercise in terms of practices of place;
- take definition of practice and exemplify in terms of a chosen image/video
- demonstrate reflexivity in relation to interpretative practices ... 

## 6. Ethnography I

Lucy did this for me in 2014!

### Objectives:

    Contextualise ethnographic methods within the field of anthropology;
    Identify connections between anthropology, science and technology studies (STS) and media, film and cultural studies;
    Think about how we delineate the boundaries of our 'units of analysis' in ethnographic projects;
    Understand how the trope of 'configuration' can work as a generative methodological tool for ethnographies of new media.

### Key quotes

The making of ethnography is artisanal, tied to the worldy work of writing (Clifford 1986: 6).

Cultures are not scientific 'objects' (assuming such things exist, even in the natural sciences).  Culture, and our views of 'it,' are produced historically, and are actively contested (Clifford 1986: 18).

My own work has been concerned with the question of how humans and machines are figured together – or configured – in contemporary technological discourses and practices, and how they might be reconfigured, or figured together differently (Suchman 2012: 49).

Configuration orients us to the entanglement of imaginaries and artefacts that comprise technological projects (Suchman 2012: 57).

### Activity

This week we'll be doing a small exercise during class time that will take you out of the classroom to do a bit of participant observation on the LU campus.  I'll explain the exercise when we meet, so no need to prepare in advance.

Write up notes on 'configuration' as a way of limiting the textual/visual environment for your research project. 
Lucy Suchman writes: 'configuration orients us to the entanglement of imaginaries and artefacts that comprise technological projects (Suchman 2012: 57).' In relation to your research project, find 2 different entanglements of 'imaginaries' and 'artefacts.'  Document these using screen shots, quotes or some other empirical material. Describe how the examples can be understood in terms of configuration. 

## 7. Ethnography II

Reading for this is Manifesto for Live Methods -- not sure if the best one
Fish on Current TV

### Objectives: 
By the end of this session, you should be able to:

1. Characterise some of the different 'live methods' emerging in contemporary social research
2. Describe how live methods differ from market research 
3. Explain how digital research tools shape our understanding of social life
4. List some of the different forms of making that might transform social research
5. Critically characterise some of the forms of participation associated with digital convergence

### Key quotes 

The tools and devices for research craft are being extended by digital culture in a hyper-connected world, affording new possibilities to re-imagine observation and the generation of alternative forms of research data. Part of the promise of live methods is the potential for simultaneity in research and the possibility of re-ordering the relationship between data gathering, analysis and circulation (Back & Puwar, 2013, 7)

The massive accumulation of digital data in the hands of corporations to generate (largely market driven) predictions is not approached as a threat which displaces the methodological edge of the sociologist, who faces an ‘empirical crisis’ (Savage and Burrows, 2007) and is left behind in the wake of digitally accelerated forms of observation and con- struction. Rather, these contemporary developments are a provocation to the sociologist to collaboratively invent devices which adapt, re-purpose and ‘take advantage of the analytic and empirical capacities that are embedded in online media’.  (Back & Puwar, 2013, 9)


### Activities

Describe and discuss some possibilities for 're-imagining observation' (Back & Puwar) in relation to your research project. These can be quite speculative or impractical, but they should refer to concrete possibilities offered by digital devices and platforms of various kinds.

Write up notes on 'configuration' as a way of limiting the textual/visual environment

## 8. Combining I

### Objectives: 

By the end of this session, you should be able to:

1. Use online databases to identify and obtain relevant academic literature;
2. Use bibliographic management software to store, cite and reference academic literature and textual materials;
3. Describe and understand the basic components of a research design;
4. Develop a basic design for a research project drawing on a range of media and cultural studies methods;
5. Reorganise a set of empirical materials according to a research design

### Quotes to use

### Activities

1. Develop the table of empirical materials you started in class, and then put it up on the blog. The table should show

 - the empirical materials you will use, with numbers that quantify how many of each thing

- the methods you will use to gather and analyse the materials

- the order in which you will work on the materials

2. Annotate the list of academic references you found relating to your research topic. You should put a full bibliographic reference for each reference. Rank or order the list of references in terms of their relevance to your project. Put the list of references on the group research blog.

3. Take 3 course outlines from courses you are doing this year. Choose 2 key texts or concepts from each outline that could relate to your research project. Put the references in some kind of order that makes sense to you -- this is hard to explain, but it should be doable. Put the list of the references or referenced concepts on the blog.

4. Put all the research questions you came up with on the blog.

## Essay question

Nick Couldry wrote in 2000: 'cultural studies is an expanding space for sustained, rigorous and self-reflexive  empirical research into the massive, power-laden complexity of contemporary culture'  (Couldry, 2000, 1).  Critically analyse what he  means. Drawing on the various interpretative, textual, visual, observational and participatory methods discussed in the course and the set readings of the course, describe some of the different ways  your group research project activities have addressed the challenges of empirically researching contemporary culture. You will need to spend some time in your essay describing what your research was about, but this description should mainly serve to highlight your analysis of this definition of cultural studies.  You should pay particular attention in your essay to the key quotes drawn from the weekly readings (see the Moodle site for these), and show in your essay that understand them and their implications.
